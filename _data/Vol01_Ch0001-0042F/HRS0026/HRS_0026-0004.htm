<p class="XNotes"> The office of the governor is a constitutional office established by §1 of article V of the state constitution and is not a principal department of the state executive branch listed in this section; thus, any agency that is not temporary and for special purposes cannot be validly placed within the office of the governor. Att. Gen Op. 96-1.</p>
