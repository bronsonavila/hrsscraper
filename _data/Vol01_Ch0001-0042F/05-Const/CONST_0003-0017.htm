<p class="XNotes"> During the forty-fifth-day special session, the legislature, in considering bills returned by the governor, may vote pursuant to this section to override the veto, may amend the bill pursuant to ยง16 to meet the governor's objections, or may take no further action on a returned bill. The pertinent constitutional provisions do not require that the legislature must take final actions by the end of the first day of the forty-fifth-day special session. The option to vote to override the veto would not be available only when the bill has already been amended, passed, and presented to the governor pursuant to the third paragraph of ยง16 of this article. Att. Gen. Op. 16-4.</p>
