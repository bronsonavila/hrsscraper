<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>Section 6.</b> The amendment to Section 3 of Article VIII shall take effect on the first day of July after two full calendar years have elapsed following the ratification of such amendment [November7, 1978]; provided that for a period of eleven years following such ratification, the policies and methods of assessing real property taxes shall be uniform throughout the State and shall be established by agreement of a majority of the political subdivisions. Each political subdivision shall enact such uniform policies and methods of assessment by ordinance before the effective date of this amendment [July1, 1981], and in the event the political subdivisions fail to enact such ordinances, the uniform policies and methods of assessment shall be established by general law. Any amendments to the uniform policies and methods of assessment established by the political subdivisions may only be made by agreement of a majority of the political subdivisions and enactment thereof by ordinance in each political subdivision.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Any statutory restrictions on the city &amp; county of Honolulu's power to create or repeal real property tax exemptions ceased to have any validity at the end of the eleven-year period specified in this section; thus, Act 227, L 1996, which attempted to extend this period merely through enactment of a state law without amending the Hawaii constitution, was unconstitutional. 99 H. 508, 57 P.3d 433.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Section 246A-2 has lapsed by its own terms and by the terms of this section. 99 H. 508, 57 P.3d 433.</p>
