<p class="XNotes"> Twenty-four hour period begins when bill is first printed and made available in the form in which it is passed on third reading, irrespective of when such form is attained; committee reports are not included in twenty-four hour requirement. Att. Gen. Op. 70-7.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Requirement applies to carry-over bills in the same manner. Att. Gen. Op. 70-10.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> A bill which does not pass in the same form in both houses cannot become law. Att. Gen. Op. 81-7.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Senate Bill No. 1394 (Act 172, L 2003) passed three readings in the senate and was validly enacted; even if the bill did not pass second reading in the senate, it did pass three readings on separate days in the senate. Att. Gen. Op. 03-6.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section requires a separate forty-eight-hour period in the senate after the house has passed, certified, and transmitted the final version of the bill to the senate; the purpose of the forty-eight-hour review period is to allow legislators and constituents to be able to review bills before third or final reading so as to avoid hasty decisions and surprises. Att. Gen. Op. 11-1.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> If the legislature is considering possible amendments to a bill returned by the governor, final actions on an amended bill cannot be taken on the first day of the forty-fifth-day special session. Att. Gen. Op. 16-4.</p>
