<p class="XNotes"> Bargained for random drug testing program for public school teachers with appropriate procedural protections is constitutional and would not violate either the federal or state Constitution. If a court were to find such a program to violate either the federal or state Constitution, the doctrine of qualified immunity would bar personal liability for any state official; if a court were to impose personal liability, based upon past history and practice, the legislature would fund payment of the claims. Att. Gen. Op. 08-1.</p>

<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> District court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff's motion for injunctive relief, where the motion did not have a relationship or nexus to the underlying complaint. Plaintiff's motion was based on potential misconduct entirely unrelated to its unfair trade practices claims; plaintiff's complaint alleged multiple claims for unfair and illegal trade practices, due process violations, etc., and did not contain a claim for improper review and use of confidential patient information in violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the state constitution. 810 F.3d 631 (2015).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Public officials' expectation of financial privacy qualified by constitution's code of ethics. 68 H. 140, 706 P.2d 814.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> A person has a right to read or view pornographic material in the privacy of one's own home, along with this right is the right to purchase such materials for personal use; section affords much greater privacy right than federal right to privacy; State must show a compelling state interest to infringe upon the right of privacy. 69 H. 483, 748 P.2d 372.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Information that must be disclosed pursuant to §92F-14(b)(4)(B) regarding a public employee's employment-related misconduct and resulting discipline not "highly personal and intimate information" and thus not within scope of Hawaii's constitutional right to privacy. 83 H. 378, 927 P.2d 386.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Purported right to possess and use marijuana not a fundamental right; where defendant failed to prove §712-1249 lacked any rational basis, section constitutional. 86 H. 440, 950 P.2d 178.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Right to privacy in this section does not encompass right to possess and use marijuana for recreational purposes. 86 H. 440, 950 P.2d 178.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Chapter 584 did not implicate father's fundamental privacy right to procreational autonomy, but rather father's economic interest in not supporting his child, and although father had standing to raise an equal protection challenge to chapter 584, that standing was based on a non-suspect classification, i.e., the biological relationship of fathers to their children; thus, because chapter 584 bears a rational relation to the public welfare, the statute survives rational basis review and father's privacy and equal protection arguments failed. 109 H. 240, 125 P.3d 461.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> The respondent judge erred in requiring the petitioner to sign a stipulated qualified protective order (SQPO) because the contested provisions of the SQPO allowed the petitioner's health information to be used for purposes outside the underlying litigation without any showing of a compelling state interest. 132 H. 408, 322 P.3d 948 (2014).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Section 711-1102 does not violate the right to privacy under this section as it is not a "sweeping infringement on the freedom of movement and privacy"; to prevent the substantial harm or serious inconvenience, annoyance or alarm to the public, it is reasonably necessary for law enforcement to order those participating in the disorderly conduct and those in the immediate vicinity to disperse until the disorderly conduct comes to an end. 101 H. 153 (App.), 64 P.3d 282.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Sections 707-730(1)(b) and 707-732(1)(b), as applied to private consensual acts between two persons, including minors, did not violate minor's right to privacy as the State has at least a significant interest in regulating the sexual activities of children under the age of fourteen; in addition, there is no fundamental personal privacy right for minors under the age of fourteen to engage in sexual activities with other children under the age of fourteen; this applies to young boys, as well as to young girls, and is not strictly dependent on an age differential between the children. 121 H. 92 (App.), 214 P.3d 1082 (2009).</p>
