<p class="XNotes"> Before enactment of §17-5, held that vacancy in senate resulting from death of candidate must be filled by governor by appointment. 52 H. 410, 477 P.2d 625. But such appointment viewed in its relationship to §17-3 would be invalid as violative of equal protection. 327 F. Supp. 745.</p>
