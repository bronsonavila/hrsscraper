<p class="XNotes"> Where Congress has not expressly set out exclusive jurisdiction, state courts are competent to decide federal claims. 437 F. Supp. 368.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Section 605-1, concerning bar examinations, does not invade judicial functions. 44 H. 27, 352 P.2d 607.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Judicial power and venue requirements distinguished. 53 H. 398, 495 P.2d 585.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Supreme court has jurisdiction over matter relating to incorporation of attorneys. 55 H. 121, 516 P.2d 1267.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Article V, §6 and this section, neither separately nor together prohibit the establishment of the administrative drivers license revocation office in the judiciary. 91 H. 212 (App.), 982 P.2d 346.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Given the mandatory nature of the case-or-controversy requirement in federal courts, it would also be possible to perfect standing during the course of litigation in state courts where the state constitution does not contain case-or-controversy language; by perfecting its interest in appellants' mortgage prior to the order granting summary judgment and entry of the decree of foreclosure in bank's favor, bank effectively cured its lack of standing at the initiation of the lawsuit. 117 H. 506 (App.), 184 P.3d 821.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As nothing in chapter 103F expressly precluded judicial review, it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; judicial review was available in connection with chapter 103F by way of a declaratory action under §632-1. 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012).</p>
