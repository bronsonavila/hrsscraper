<p class="XNotes"> Sanctions awarded pursuant to rule 26 of Hawaii arbitration rules did not violate due process or this section. 76 H. 494, 880 P.2d 169.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Apart from the past or present terms of the relevant statutes, as between the common-law practice of England, and its analogue developed under this jurisdiction, the latter controls for purposes of this section. 91 H. 81, 979 P.2d 1107.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Based on the established common law convention of this jurisdiction at the time of adoption of the state constitution, as a general matter, a right to jury trial exists in state eminent domain proceedings. 91 H. 81, 979 P.2d 1107.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Employer was entitled to a jury trial, under this section, with respect to employees' allegation of sexual discrimination and retaliation, as §368-17(a) empowered the Hawaii civil rights commission to award legal forms of relief, and, in proceedings before the commission, the employees and executive director claimed legal relief in the form of monetary damages of $400,000 for each employee. 101 H. 438, 71 P.3d 389.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Defendants were not denied their right to a jury trial by virtue of the trial court's imposing an unjust enrichment award against them; because plaintiffs' damages were not ascertainable or remediable by reference to the contractual remedies provided for, equitable remedies were appropriate; thus, trial court did not abuse its discretion by considering the jury's verdict to be only advisory or by imposing an equitable remedy. 116 H. 42 (App.), 169 P.3d 994.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> A fundamental constitutional right to a jury trial exists when a person is faced with substantial legal damages in a statutory discrimination action; where there was no reasoned basis for concluding that a person has a fundamental constitutional right if the Hawaii civil rights commission awards such damages, but no fundamental constitutional right if a court awards such damages, landlord was entitled to a jury trial with respect to tenant's demand for substantial compensatory and punitive damages. 128 H. 159 (App.), 284 P.3d 932 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although reasonable conditions may be placed upon the fundamental right to a jury trial in civil cases, including rules and procedures affecting its exercise, where, under the circumstances of the case, the Hawaii civil rights commission (HCRC) executive director's opposition to removal to court and declaration that landlord's procedural rights had been waived made the right "practically unavailable" to landlord because there was no method to remove the case absent the executive director doing so, landlord did not waive landlord's right to a jury trial during the HCRC proceedings. 128 H. 159 (App.), 284 P.3d 932 (2012).</p>
