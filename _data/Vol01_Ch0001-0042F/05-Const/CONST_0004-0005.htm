<p class="XNotes"> A proposal of the 1978 Constitutional Convention deleting this provision from the Constitution was not validly ratified. Kahalekai v. Doi, 60 H. 324, 590 P.2d 543. In view of the holding, the revisor has restored this provision (formerly a part of section 4 of the old Article III), with a necessary change in reference, and renumbered it as section 5 under the authority of Resolution No. 29 of the 1978 Constitutional Convention.</p>
