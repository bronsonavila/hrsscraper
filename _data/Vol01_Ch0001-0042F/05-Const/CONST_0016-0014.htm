<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> A proposal of the 1978 Constitutional Convention deleted a second paragraph which read: "Whenever any personal pronoun appears in this constitution, it shall be construed to mean either sex." This deletion appears to be one of the unspecified changes submitted for ratification under Question 34. On whether any of the changes submitted under Question 34 was in fact approved by the electorate, see Kahalekai v. Doi, 60 H. 324, 590 P.2d 543, excerpted in the note preceding the Preamble to the Constitution.</p>
