<p class="XNotes"> Rule adopted by the commission, authorizing the commission to appoint its administrative assistant and such other staff as it believes necessary for its successful operation and exempting all staff positions it may from time to time create from the civil service and collective bargaining, was valid. The commission was well within its authority to ask the judiciary to rescind the judiciary's selection of a civil service replacement for its current administrative assistant II, and furnish all administrative support necessary to reestablish its administrative assistant II position as an exempt position effective January 1, 2008, and assist the commission in advertising, interviewing, and selecting a replacement for its incumbent upon the incumbent's retirement. Att. Gen. Op. 07-3.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Confidentiality requirement of rule 7 of the rules of the judicial selection commission does not apply to the governor or the chief justice after the judicial selection commission has submitted its lists of judicial nominees for consideration; it is within the sole discretion of appointing authorities whether to make public disclosure of the commissions lists of judicial nominees. 75 H. 333, 861 P.2d 723.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Section neither expressly mandates that lists containing the names of the judicial selection commissions judicial nominees remain confidential nor that they be publicly disclosed. Petitioner failed to meet burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that rule 7 of the rules of the judicial selection commission was a plain, clear, manifest, and unmistakable violation of this section. 75 H. 333, 861 P.2d 723.</p>
