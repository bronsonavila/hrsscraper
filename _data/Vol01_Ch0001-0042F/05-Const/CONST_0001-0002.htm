<p class="XNotes"> Section 286-81(1)(A), requiring motorcycle safety helmets, is not a mere self-protective legislation and is valid. 55 H. 138, 516 P.2d 709.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Traffic statutes, §§286-25, 286-102, 291-11.6, and 431:10C-104(b), did not violate defendants freedom of movement. 77 H. 222 (App.), 883 P.2d 644.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> A chapter 586 protective order does not unconstitutionally curtail a person's freedom of movement. 85 H. 197 (App.), 940 P.2d 404.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As §711-1102's limit on freedom of association and movement is only within the immediate vicinity of the disorderly conduct and there is no "unlimited and indiscriminately sweeping infringement upon the freedom of movement and association", §711-1102 does not violate this section. 101 H. 153 (App.), 64 P.3d 282.</p>
