<p class="XNotes"> Act 3, L Sp 2007 1st, requiring the Hawaii community development authority to set aside state lands for use by the Kewalo Keiki Fishing Conservancy (KKFC), a private nonprofit section 501(c)(3) organization under the Internal Revenue Code, violated this section; Act 3 could only be interpreted as being a special legislation because it was enacted to benefit the KKFC specifically and was limited to a specific property. Att. Gen. Op. 07-2.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Where Act 2, L Sp 2007 2d created a class that was "logically and factually limited to a 'class of one' ", that is, it was not reasonably probable that other members could enter the class in the future, the class was illusory; thus, Act 2 was a special law in violation of this section and the circuit court erred when it concluded that Act 2 was constitutional and dismissed plaintiff's claims as moot. 120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where, without the legal authority provided by ยง15 of Act 2, L Sp 2007 2d through an exercise of legislative power, the operating agreement between the superferry and the state department of transportation would have remained void and unenforceable by the circuit court's order as it related to the lands at Kahului Harbor, Act 2 was an exercise of legislative power over state lands. 120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226.</p>
