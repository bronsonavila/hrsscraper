<p class="XNotes"> Section does not enlarge subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts. 714 F.2d 77.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Chapter 205 is a law relating to environmental quality within the meaning of this section as it implements the guarantee of a clean and healthful environment established by this section. 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> In the circumstances of the case, this section created a private right of action to enforce chapter 205, and the legislature confirmed the existence of that right of action by enacting §607-25, which allows for the recovery of attorneys' fees in such actions. 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section is self-executing, and §205-12 imposes "reasonable limitations and regulations" that were applicable to the case which allowed the private right of action to enforce chapter 205. 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Because: (1) §6E-13(b) allows a suit to be brought only for a restraining order or injunctive relief and is an exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine for which no waiver is necessary, and therefore does not contain a waiver of the State's sovereign immunity; and (2) nothing in this section expressly waived the State's immunity for attorney's fees, there was no clear relinquishment of the State's sovereign immunity, and thus, the State's immunity barred petitioner's request for fees based on the private attorney doctrine. 129 H. 454, 304 P.3d 252 (2013).</p>
