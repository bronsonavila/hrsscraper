<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff citizens had not shown a likelihood of succeeding on their claim that Hawaii's legislative reapportionment plan's use of a permanent resident base, coupled with extraction of military personnel, their dependents, and students, constituted an equal protection violation for the purpose of a preliminary injunction; further, the equities and public interest tipped overwhelmingly in defendant reapportionment commission's favor, as any preliminary relief at this stage would significantly upend the election process; plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction denied. 878 F. Supp. 2d 1124 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the final reapportionment plan included thousands of non-permanent university student residents and non-permanent active duty military residents, as well as thousands of other non-permanent residents who were the dependents of the non-permanent active duty military residents, the plan disregarded the express mandate of this section that only permanent residents be counted in the population base for the purpose of reapportionment of the state legislature; the inclusion of non-permanent residents was an error in the plan rendering the plan constitutionally invalid under this section. 126 H. 283, 270 P.3d 1013 (2012).</p>
