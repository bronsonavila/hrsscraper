<p class="XNotes"> This section requires legislative action to become operative; the nature of the required legislative action, at the least, is the adoption of standards and criteria; because this section is not "complete in itself", it requires implementing legislation. 102 H. 465, 78 P.3d 1.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Until standards and criteria for the preservation of agricultural lands are adopted by the legislature, this section is legally inoperative; thus, developer's lands could be rezoned without a two-thirds majority vote of the city council; trial court correctly ruled that passage of council rezoning bill by simple majority did not violate this section. 102 H. 465, 78 P.3d 1.</p>
