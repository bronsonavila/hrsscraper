<p class="XNotes"> Petitioners had standing to invoke Hawaii supreme court's remedial power of mandamus where petitioners' constitutional duty, as senators who must advise and consent on governor's board of regents nominees under this section, was usurped by governor's holding over of six regents whose terms had expired, and this deprivation of the right to advise and consent on regent appointments was sufficiently personal to constitute an injury in fact. 119 H. 341, 198 P.3d 604.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Respondent's application of the holdover provision of §304A-104(a) to the six regents whose terms had expired contravened L 2007, Act 56, §§1 and 5 and was contrary to the modified appointment process for regents prescribed by this section. 119 H. 341, 198 P.3d 604.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The governor's nondiscretionary duty--pursuant to this section, and §§304A-104(a) and 304A-104.5(e)--to nominate and appoint members of the board of regents of the University of Hawaii, is subject to a reasonable time standard; reasonable time is judged by the totality of the circumstances; the passage of nearly ten months since the governor was presented with the regent candidate list was an unreasonable period of time for the governor to perform this constitutional and statutory duty and the governor was thus subject to mandamus. 119 H. 341, 198 P.3d 604.</p>
