<p class="XNotes"> Rejection, previous to 1893, of essential parts of common law justifies present rejection of other parts; and previous application (contrary to common law) of a general principle to one question justifies subsequent application to another question. 10 H. 421, 436; 12 H. 375, 380; 16 H. 615, 628; 31 H. 661, 669, reh'g denied 31 H. 796; 40 H. 92; 45 H. 373, 384, 369 P.2d 96.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Appellants' contention that native Hawaiian rights were exclusive and possessory was unsupported in the law. 76 F.3d 280.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> If plaintiff could prove that its custom and usage of subject land, prior to 1892, established its right of occupancy and use based upon the doctrine of individual aboriginal title, then that doctrine, as established in 1923, would apply. Any aboriginal title that plaintiff may have had was extinguished; plaintiff failed to show that its use and occupancy of the area was exclusive as required by the doctrine. 875 F. Supp. 680.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff's claims of reserved rights of native tenants under Hawaii law did not extend to the right of perpetual and exclusive occupancy upon the land of another; plaintiff's ancestors' failure to claim kuleana title to subject land, which rendered them tenants at sufferance, foreclosed plaintiff's attempt to claim possessory rights to the land under Hawaii law. 875 F.

<p class="XNotes"> No evidence that "Hawaiian usage" gave to owner of land along seashore title to lava extensions created by volcanic eruption. 58 H. 106, 566 P.2d 725.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where practices have, without harm to anyone, been continued, reference to Hawaiian usage in section insures their continuance for so long as no actual harm is done thereby. Retention of a Hawaiian tradition should in each case be determined by balancing respective interests and harm once it is established that application of the custom has continued in a particular area. 66 H. 1, 656 P.2d 745.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> "Hawaiian usage" clause may establish certain customary Hawaiian rights beyond those found in §7-1. 73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> If property is deemed "fully developed", i.e., lands zoned and used for residential purposes with existing dwellings, improvements, and infrastructure, it is always "inconsistent" to permit the practice of traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights on such property. 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> To establish the existence of a traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice, there must be an adequate foundation in the record connecting the claimed right to a firmly rooted traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice. 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support claim of the exercise of a constitutionally protected native Hawaiian right and knowingly entered landowner's property which was fenced in a manner to exclude others, trial court properly concluded that defendant was unlawfully on property in violation of §708-814(1). 89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.</p>
