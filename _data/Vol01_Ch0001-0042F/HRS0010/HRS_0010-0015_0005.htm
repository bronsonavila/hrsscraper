<p class="XNotes"> Act 304, Session Laws of Hawaii 1990, was invalidated by its own severability clause because amendments made to §§10-2 and 10-13.5 by Act 304 were found to conflict with the federal Forgiveness Act (Pub. L. No. 105-66, §340, 111 Stat. at 1448); thus, §14 of Act 304, codified as §10-15.5, is repealed.</p>
