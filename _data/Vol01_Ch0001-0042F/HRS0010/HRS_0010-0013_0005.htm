<p class="XNotes"> Legislature must again determine which income and proceeds from the public land trust lands are to go to the office of Hawaiian affairs (OHA). Until legislature reestablishes a funding mechanism for OHA, Executive Order No. 03-03 is the only mechanism in place for transferring receipts from the use of ceded lands to OHA; receipts from the sale or transfer of biogenetic resources do not qualify for transfer under the order. Att. Gen. Op. 03-3.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Receipts derived from ceded lands apportioned for native Hawaiians pursuant to article XII, §6 of the state constitution and this section may be transmitted directly to office of Hawaiian affairs by agencies that collect them, without legislative appropriation. Att. Gen. Op. 03-4.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Section contained no judicially discoverable or manageable standards that could be employed to resolve OHA's claims to twenty per cent of revenues. 69 H. 154, 737 P.2d 446.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 304, L 1990, was invalidated by its own severability clause when amendment to this section by Act 304 was found to conflict with the federal Forgiveness Act (Pub. L. No. 105-66, §340, 111 Stat. at 1448), leaving court with no judicially manageable standards to determine whether office of Hawaiian affairs was entitled to the specific revenues sought in the suit. 96 H. 388, 31 P.3d 901.</p>
