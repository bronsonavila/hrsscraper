<p class="XNotes"> Where county board of registration only ruled on the individual's right to be or remain a registered voter, which was within the scope of its jurisdiction, and did not mention any possible consequences for the individual's candidacy under the provision applicable to a candidate whose nomination papers have been successfully challenged, board did not exceed its jurisdiction in finding that individual was a candidate for the council seat, an undisputed fact that provided background and context for the appeal, and entering conclusions of law containing extraneous information on the county charter and the residency requirement for running for a council seat. 121 H. 297, 219 P.3d 1084 (2009).</p>
