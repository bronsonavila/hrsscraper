<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) As provided in section 11-118;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) For the limitations of the voting system in use; and</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) In elections using the paper ballot or electronic voting systems where the names of the candidates are printed and the voter records the voter's vote on the face of the ballot, the following format shall be used: A horizontal line shall be ruled between each candidate's name and the next name, except between the names of presidential and vice presidential candidates and candidates for governor and lieutenant governor of the same political party in the general election. In such case the horizontal line shall follow the name of the candidates for vice president and lieutenant governor of the same political party, thereby grouping the candidates for president and vice president and governor and lieutenant governor of the same political party within the same pair of horizontal lines. </p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Immediately to the left of (before) or to the right of (after) the candidate name or names, according to the requirements of the voting system, two vertical lines shall be ruled, so that in conjunction with the horizontal lines, a box shall be formed to the left of or to the right of the name and its equivalent, if any.</p>
