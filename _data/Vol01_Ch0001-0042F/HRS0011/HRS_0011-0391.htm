<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§</b><b>11-391 Advertisements.</b> (a) Any advertisement that is broadcast, televised, circulated, published, distributed, or otherwise communicated, including by electronic means, shall:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Contain the name and address of the candidate, candidate committee, noncandidate committee, or other person paying for the advertisement;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Contain a notice in a prominent location stating either that:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The advertisement has the approval and authority of the candidate; provided that an advertisement paid for by a candidate, candidate committee, or ballot issue committee does not need to include the notice; or</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) The advertisement has not been approved by the candidate; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Not contain false information about the time, date, place, or means of voting.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The fine for violation of this section, if assessed by the commission, shall not exceed $25 for each advertisement that lacks the information required by this section or provides prohibited information, and shall not exceed an aggregate amount of $5,000.

<p class="XNotes"> The disclaimer requirement under subsection (a)(2) did not violate the First Amendment as applied to plaintiff's political advertisements. 786 F.3d 1182 (2015).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor had standing to challenge the "advertising" disclaimer requirements in subsection (a)(2)(B); first, even if plaintiff had already published advertisements with the disclaimers, it did not mean that it faced no injury; second, plaintiff sought a declaration that it need not include disclaimers in the future and challenged those statutes facially; third, plaintiff did not have to publish the advertisements without the disclaimers to have standing; finally, a favorable ruling would have enabled plaintiff to publish its advertisements without the disclaimers and fear of violating the law. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor's as-applied challenge to the disclaimer requirement in subsection (a)(2)(B) and the corresponding definition of "advertisement" in §11-302, which included the "electioneering communications" definitions in §11-341(c), rejected; the court concluded that the plaintiff's advertisements fit within the regulatory "safe harbor"--they were an "advertisement" that was an "electioneering communication" and was the functional equivalent of express advocacy under §11-341(c). 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor's facial challenge to the disclaimer requirement in subsection (a)(2)(B) failed; disclosure requirements could apply to issue advocacy, so long as the exacting scrutiny test was otherwise met, and disclosure and disclaimer requirements--such as requiring a disclaimer under federal law that a communication "was not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee"--satisfied the exacting scrutiny test; in effect, the U.S. Supreme Court in "Citizens United had effectively disposed of any attack on ... attribution and disclaimer requirements". 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>
