<p class="XNotes"> Where political party did not develop evidence showing that the State's open primary system severely burdened its associational rights, the party's facial challenge failed; among other things, the party provided no evidence showing a "clear and present danger" that adherents of opposing parties determined the party's nominees. 833 F.3d 1119 (2016).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiff claimed provisions requiring an open primary were facially unconstitutional because allowing voters to associate anonymously with a political party violated a party's First Amendment right of free association: (1) plaintiff's purely facial challenge to the open primary failed; and (2) the court could not assess whether plaintiff's associational rights were burdened without considering evidence as to the extent, if any, of that burden. 982 F. Supp. 2d 1166 (2013).</p>
