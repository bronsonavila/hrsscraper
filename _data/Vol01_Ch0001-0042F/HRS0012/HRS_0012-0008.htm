<p class="XNotes"> Judgment by trial court void where judgment was not entered until more than a month after the last day the judgment should have been entered under a mandatory reading of this section and two days after the primary election; it was the legislature's intent that time was to be a limitation and that the provisions requiring that judgment be issued within nine days of the summons being served are mandatory rather than directory; judgment vacated and case remanded. 129 H. 77 (App.), 293 P.3d 617 (2012).</p>
