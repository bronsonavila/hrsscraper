<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §216. Insurance by borrowers; acceleration of loans; lien and enforcement thereof.</b> (a) The department may require the borrower to insure, in such amount as the department may prescribe, any livestock, aquaculture stock, swine, poultry, fowl, machinery, equipment, dwellings, and permanent improvements purchased or constructed out of any moneys loaned or assured by the department; or, in lieu thereof, the department may directly take out such insurance and add the cost thereof to the amount of principal payable under the loan.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Whenever the department has reason to believe that the borrower has violated any condition enumerated in paragraph (2), (4), (5), or (6) of section 215 of this Act, the department shall give due notice and afford opportunity for a hearing to the borrower or the successor or successors to his interest, as the case demands. If upon such hearing the department finds that the borrower has violated the condition, the department may declare all principal and interest of the loan immediately due and payable notwithstanding any provision in the contract of loan to the contrary.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The department shall have a first lien upon the borrower's or lessee's interest in any lease, growing crops, aquacultural stock, either on his tract or share in any collective contract or program, livestock, swine, poultry, fowl, aquaculture stock, machinery, and equipment purchased with moneys loaned by the department, and in any dwellings or other permanent improvements on any leasehold tract, to the amount of all principal and interest due and unpaid and of all taxes and insurance and improvements paid by the department, and any other indebtedness of the borrower, the payment of which has been assured by the department. Such lien shall have priority over any other obligation for which the property subject to the lien may be security.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The department may, subject to this Act and procedures established by rule, enforce any lien by declaring the borrower's interest in the property subject to the lien to be forfeited, any lease held by the borrower canceled, and shall thereupon order such leasehold premises vacated and the property subject to the lien surrendered within a reasonable time. The right to the use and occupancy of the Hawaiian home lands contained in such lease shall thereupon revest in the department, and the department may take possession of the premises covered therein and the improvements and growing crops or improvements and aquaculture stock thereon; provided that the department shall pay to the borrower any difference which may be due him after the appraisal provided for in section 209 has been made.
