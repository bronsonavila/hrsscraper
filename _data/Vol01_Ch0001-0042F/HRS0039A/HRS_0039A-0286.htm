<p class="1Paragraph"> (11) The issuance of the special purpose revenue bonds, whether incurred prior to or after the issuance of the bonds.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The legislature finds and determines that the exercise of the powers vested in the department by this part constitutes assistance to not-for-profit private organizations, for-profit private organizations, and public instrumentalities and their qualified affiliates in the development of low- and moderate-income housing, and that the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance or refinance projects of or for project parties or to loan the proceeds of the bonds to assist project parties in the development of low- and moderate-income housing is in the public interest. The legislature further finds that this governmental assistance to not-for-profit private organizations, for-profit private organizations, and public instrumentalities and their qualified affiliates is necessary to encourage public-private partnerships to develop affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in the State.
