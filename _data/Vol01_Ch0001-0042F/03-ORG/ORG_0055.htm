<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§55.</b> That the legislative power of the Territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States locally applicable. The legislature shall not grant to any corporation, association, or individual any special or exclusive privilege, immunity, or franchise without the approval of Congress; nor shall it grant private charters, but it may by general act permit persons to associate themselves together as bodies corporate for manufacturing, agriculture, and other industrial pursuits, and for conducting the business of insurance, savings banks, banks of discount and deposit (but not of issue), loan, trust, and guaranty associations, for the establishment and conduct of cemeteries, and for the construction and operation of railroads, wagon roads, vessels, and irrigating ditches, and the colonization and improvement of lands in connection therewith, or for colleges, seminaries, churches, libraries, or any other benevolent, charitable, or scientific association. No divorce shall be granted by the legislature, nor shall any divorce be granted by the courts of the Territory unless the applicant therefor shall have resided in the Territory for two years next preceding the application, but this provision shall not affect any action pending when this Act takes effect; nor shall any lottery or sale of lottery tickets be allowed; nor shall spiritous or intoxicating liquors be sold except under such regulations and restrictions as the Territorial legislature shall provide; nor shall any public money be appropriated for the support or benefit of any sectarian, denominational, or private school, or any school not under the exclusive control of the government; nor shall the government of the Territory of Hawaii, or any political or municipal corporation or subdivision of the Territory, make any subscription to the capital stock of any incorporated company, or in any manner lend its credit for the use thereof; nor shall any debt be authorized to be contracted by or on behalf of the Territory, or any political or municipal corporation or subdivision thereof, except to pay the interest upon the existing indebtedness, to suppress insurrection, or to provide for the common defense, except that in addition to any indebtedness created for such purposes the legislature may authorize loans by the Territory, or any such subdivision thereof, for the erection of penal, charitable, and educational institutions, and for public buildings, wharves, roads, harbors, and other public improvements, but the total indebtedness of the Territory shall not at any time be extended beyond 10 per centum of the assessed value of the property in the Territory and the total indebtedness of any such subdivision shall not at any time be extended beyond 5 per centum of the assessed value of property in the subdivision, as shown by the then latest assessments for taxation, whether such assessments are made in either case by the Territory or subdivision, but nothing in this Act shall prevent the refunding of any indebtedness at any time; nor shall any such loan be made upon the credit of the public domain or any part thereof; nor shall any bond or other instrument of any such indebtedness be issued unless made payable in not more than thirty years from the date of the issue thereof; nor shall any issue of bonds or other instruments of any such indebtedness be made after July 1, 1926, other than such bonds or other instruments of indebtedness in serial form maturing in substantially equal annual instalments, the first instalment to mature not later than five years from the date of the issue of such series, and the last instalment not later than thirty years from the date of such issue; nor shall any such bond or indebtedness be issued or incurred until approved by the President of the United States: Provided, That the legislature may by general act provide for the condemnation of property for public uses, including the condemnation of rights of way for the transmission of water for irrigation and other purposes.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> On or before June1 of the year 1959, and of each tenth year thereafter, the governor shall reapportion the members of the house of representatives in the following manner: The total number of representatives shall first be reapportioned among four basic areas; namely, (1) the island of Hawaii, (2) the islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe, (3) the island of Oahu and all other islands not specifically enumerated, and (4) the islands of Kauai and Niihau, on the basis of the number of voters registered at the last preceding general election in each of such basic areas and computed by the method known as the method of equal proportions, no basic area to receive less than one member. Upon the determination of the total number of representatives to which each basic area is entitled, such total shall be reapportioned among the one or more representative districts within each basic area on the basis of the number of voters registered at the last preceding general election within each of such representative districts and computed by the method known as the method of equal proportions no representative district to receive less than one member. Upon any reapportionment, should the total number of voters registered in any representative district be less than one-half of the quotient obtained by dividing the total number of voters registered in the Territory by the total number of members to which the house is entitled, then, as part of such reapportionment, the basic area within which such representative district lies shall be redistricted by the governor in such manner that the total number of voters registered in each new representative district therein shall be more than one-half of such quotient.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The governor shall thereupon issue a proclamation showing the results of such reapportionment, and such reapportionment shall be effective for the election of members to such house for the next five succeeding legislatures.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Original jurisdiction is hereby vested in the supreme court of the Territory to be exercised on the application of any registered voter, made within thirty days following the date specified above, to compel, by mandamus or otherwise, the governor to perform the above duty; and made within thirty days following the date of such proclamation, to compel, by mandamus or otherwise, the correction of any error made in such reapportionment. [Am May27, 1910, c 258, §4, 36 Stat 444; July9, 1921, c 42, §302, 42 Stat 116; June9, 1926, c 512, §§1, 2, 44 Stat 710; Aug.1, 1956, c 851, §7, 70 Stat 907; Aug.20, 1958, Pub L 85-690, §3, 72 Stat 684]</p>

<p class="XNotesHeading">General Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Congress, from time to time, has ratified territorial bond acts and has authorized particular issues. For the years 1933 to 1942 inclusive, see the Acts of July15, 1935, August3, 1935, May28, 1937, July10, 1937 (four Acts), May13, 1938, August7, 1939, November 21, 1941, and May5, 1942 cited in the Chronological Note of Acts Affecting Hawaii, RLH 1955, page 9; see also 48 U.S.C.A. 562a to j, and the list of loan fund acts in the appendix, note 6, RLH 1955, p. 1731.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Before §55 was amended, a county could not issue bonds unless it had the power of taxation: 19 H. 9. Legislation substantially lessening the security for payment of county bonds by reducing county revenue might be invalid as an impairment of contract obligations: 19 H. 17. Limitation on indebtedness of municipality applies to indebtedness imposed by legislature on, as well as that incurred by, the municipality: 25 H. 335. Street improvement bonds to be financed by assessments not municipal "indebtedness", 33 H. 731.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> For construction with reference to delegation of power, of bond statute which in terms was to take effect on the President's approval, see note to §50.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Other territories: Compare this §55 of the Org. Act with Rev. Sts., §§1851, 1889; 23 Stat 348; 24 Stat 170; 25 Stat 336; 29 Stat 136, covering similar subjects in relation to territories in general, all of which may have been by implication inapplicable to Hawaii before the amendment of §5 and were made inapplicable expressly by that amendment. See note to §56.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> By this § full congressional legislative power within its terms was delegated to the territorial legislature, 54 F.2d 313. While the power of Congress to legislate for a territory, directly or through a local legislature, is derived from the Constitution (195 U.S. 140), it is derived, not from the enumerated specific powers, but from the general power to make "needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States" or by implication from the power to acquire and hold territory and the fact that there is no other legislative power over such territory, or from both these sources (136 U.S. 42‑44); (182 U.S. 290; 195 U.S. 140; 118 U.S. 380). Hence such legislative power over territories is not subject to the limitations applicable to the power of Congress over the states, except as set forth in the note to §5 of this Act, but in general is the equivalent of the combined federal and state legislative power over a state and extends to "all rightful subjects of legislation." 175 U.S. 168; 239 U.S. 365; 137 U.S. 684; 152 U.S. 48; 201 U.S. 308; 251 U.S. 406; 171 Fed. 488; 86 Fed. 456. Congress may abrogate territorial laws or legislate directly for the territories. 305 U.S. 306, affg. 96 F.2d 412, and 33 H. 890.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Pursuant to section 73(c), certain land laws are not subject to repeal or amendment by the legislature without the approval of Congress.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> By the Act of April19, 1930, the Hawaii National Park was removed from territorial jurisdiction except for certain purposes therein stated. This Act is set out following the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As to military and naval reservations see the note to section 2. As to taxation see the following Acts of general application throughout the United States: Act of June16, 1936 known as Hayden-Cartwright Act, c 582, §10, 49 Stat 1518, 1521, as amended October9, 1940, c 787, §7, 54 Stat 1059, 1060, construed in 38 Ops. 519; Act of October9, 1940, known as the Buck Act, c 787, 54 Stat 1059.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> The provisions of this § against granting special franchises and private charters do not apply to grants of powers to municipal corporations: 19 H. 176; nor do they prevent the imposition of a license fee for fishing for profit with boats exceeding a certain width: 19 H. 643; 27 H. 7. See 40 H. 604.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Claim of special privilege through the grant of an exemption not raised by general demurrer, 33 H. 196.

<p class="XNotes"> The absence of legislation for licenses to clubs to sell liquor is no defense for a club selling without a license; 16 H. 509; nor has an ex-licensee such a vested right as will entitle him to sell his stock of liquor after the expiration of his license: 18 H. 406. Congress provided by Joint Resolution of April26, 1910 (36 Stat 878) for a special election on prohibition, at which election the vote was against prohibition.
