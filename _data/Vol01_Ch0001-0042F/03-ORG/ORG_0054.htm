<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> ยง54. </b>That in case of failure of the legislature to pass appropriation bills providing for payments of the necessary current expenses of carrying on the government and meeting its legal obligations as the same are provided for by the then existing laws, the governor shall, upon the adjournment of the legislature, call it in extra session for the consideration of appropriation bills, and until the legislature shall have acted the treasurer may, with the advice of the governor, make such payments, for which purpose the sums appropriated in the last appropriation bill shall be deemed to have been reappropriated. And all legislative and other appropriations made prior to the date when this Act shall take effect, shall be available to the government of the Territory of Hawaii.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> The legislature in extra session under this ยง may divide the biennial period, covering a portion of it by one appropriation bill and the rest by another: 15 H. 361. The objects for which appropriations may be made in such extra session are not limited to "necessary current expenses," etc.: 15 H. 514, 663. When a complete appropriation bill was passed for the first six months of the biennial period and only an incomplete one for the last eighteen months because the remainder of the expenses were expected to be provided for by counties, and the county act turned out to be void, there was a "failure" within the meaning of this section, but the "last appropriation bills" to be resorted to were those of the previous biennial period and not those of the first six months of the period in question: 15 H. 532. Referred to in 16 H. 245.</p>
