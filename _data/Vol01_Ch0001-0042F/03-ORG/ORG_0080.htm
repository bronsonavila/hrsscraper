The words "and until their successors are appointed and qualified" apply to officers appointed by the President as well as to those appointed by the governor under this §: 42 C. Cls. R. 54. This § does not invalidate a territorial statute authorizing the chief justice to designate a circuit judge of one circuit to sit in place of a circuit judge of another circuit who is absent, disqualified: 26 H. 557, 290 Fed. 146. This § is controlled by §56, which authorizes the appointment and election of officers of municipal corporations in other ways: 16 H. 779.
