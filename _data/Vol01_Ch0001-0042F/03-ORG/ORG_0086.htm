<p class="XNotes"> Other questions of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction: Federal court has jurisdiction of adultery under federal statutes, even though the territorial courts have like jurisdiction, under territorial statutes: 3 U.S.D.C. Haw. 262; 3 U.S.D.C. Haw. 517; but an acquittal or conviction in either court will bar a trial in the other: 3 U.S.D.C. Haw. 295. Territorial courts have not concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction in bankruptcy, and the federal court in bankruptcy, may, pending hearing, restrain a sale of the bankrupt's property on execution under a territorial court judgment: 1 U.S.D.C.

Decisions of the territorial supreme court construing charters granted by the Hawaiian legislature, are binding on the federal court, when no federal question is involved: 1 U.S.D.C. Haw. 164. See also note to §81 and note on practice in U.S. Court, below.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Removal of criminal case from territorial to federal court: Federal statute providing for removal of cause from "state" to federal court when defendant acted under color of office applied to homicide case commenced in territorial court; the word "state" in the removal statute may be sufficient to include territories, but in any event §86 makes this removal statute applicable in Hawaii. 132 F.2d 374.
