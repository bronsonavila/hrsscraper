<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §14. General elections.</b> That a general election shall be held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, nineteen hundred, and every second year thereafter: Provided, however, That the governor may in his discretion, on thirty days' notice, order a special election before the first general election, if, in his opinion, the public interests shall require a special session of the legislature.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Although legislature is authorized by §85, as amended, to amend election laws of Territory, it cannot change time for holding elections of members of legislature prescribed by this §14 of the Org. Act, by providing that a candidate receiving a majority at direct primary shall be thereby elected: 22 H. 247. But such provision is valid and operative as to county supervisor notwithstanding that there are more than one to be elected: 22 H. 520. Referred to in 15 H. 266; 16 H. 245; 20 H. 295. See §85, election of delegate; §64.</p>
