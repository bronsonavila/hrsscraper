<p class="XNotes"> An act authorizing an issuance of bonds was held to take effect upon its passage over governor's veto, although by its terms it was to "take effect" upon "its approval by the president," the latter words being held intended to refer to president's approval of issuance of the bonds, under ยง55, and not to be an attempt to delegate power: 19 H. 12; 26 Ops. 463.</p>
