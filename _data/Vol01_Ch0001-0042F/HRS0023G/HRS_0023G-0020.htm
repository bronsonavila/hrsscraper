<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> ยง23G-20 Continuous statutory revision.</b> The revisor of statutes shall conduct a systematic and continuing study of the laws of Hawaii for the purpose of reducing their number and bulk, removing inconsistencies, redundancies, unnecessary repetitions and otherwise improving their clarity. For these purposes the revisor shall:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Prepare and submit to the legislature, prior to each regular session thereof, a report as to defects in the laws and statutes of Hawaii, and draft in the form of bills and resolutions proposed legislation to carry out the recommendations contained in the report;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Prepare for submission to the legislature, from time to time, a rewriting and revision, either complete, partial, or topical of the laws of Hawaii. [L Sp 1977 1st, c 8, pt of ยง1]</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Revised laws, when enacted, have same validity as any new enactment though from standpoint of interpretation they are construed as continuations of previously existing laws. 283 F.2d 86.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Revised laws may be enacted by a separate short act, and such enactment gives force of law to provisions that may constitutionally be enacted in form contained therein, even if derived from an unconstitutional statute. 17 H. 566; 25 H. 638, 640.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Statutes carried into a revision retained their original effect unless legislative intent to make a change is clear. 23 H. 91, 95; 28 H. 744, 751; 29 H. 820, 824. This is particularly true where statute has been construed before its incorporation into the revision. 23 H. 91, 95. See also 24 H. 258, 262.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Section of revised laws construed by reference to original act though portions of the section as originally enacted omitted from revised laws. 33 H. 915, 916.</p>
