<p class="XNotes"> Where applicants, passengers on vessel intercepted by U.S. Coast Guard and brought to Midway Island, argued that Immigration and Nationality Act effectively eliminated habeas jurisdiction and that such a repeal violated the suspension clause, Congress had not provided the benefit of a habeas corpus proceeding for aliens who were not in the United States; thus, applicants had no constitutional claim. 71 F. Supp. 2d 1052.</p>
