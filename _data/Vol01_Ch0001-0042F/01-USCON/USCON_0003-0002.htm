<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the restriction on office of Hawaiian affairs trustee appointments to Hawaiians, because plaintiffs neither alleged nor provided evidence of any injury related to the appointment process. 314 F.3d 1091.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Appellant lacked standing to challenge (1) office of Hawaiian affairs business loan program where appellant failed to demonstrate an injury in fact; and (2) native Hawaiian eligibility requirement for Hawaiian homestead leases because appellant's injury was not redressable. 342 F.3d 934.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Appellant who contended, among other things, injury by the provisions of article XII of the state constitution and chapter 10 personally subjecting appellant to racial classification, lacked standing as appellant did not suffer an injury in fact. 342 F.3d 934.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs who challenged the department of Hawaiian home lands (DHHL)/Hawaiian homes commission (HHC) lease eligibility programs in their capacity as state taxpayers, lacked standing to sue the United States and the United States remained an indispensable party to any challenge to the DHHL/HHC lease eligibility criteria; plaintiffs did not have standing as state taxpayers to challenge the appropriation of state revenue to the office of Hawaiian affairs. 477 F.3d 1048.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief arising from the government's seizure of marijuana met the constitutional requirements and prudential factors for ripeness, and plaintiffs had associational standing to assert the claims; seizure of plaintiffs' marijuana that had already occurred created a justiciable case and controversy about plaintiffs' constitutional and statutory entitlement to use marijuana for religious purposes; adjudication of plaintiffs' claims did not require that the court entangle itself in hypothetical scenarios or "abstract disagreements". 676 F.3d 829 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff wedding event professionals association had Article III standing to assert claims on behalf of those who sought to marry on an unencumbered state beach in Hawaii; application of department of land and natural resources regulations to commercial weddings had resulted in economic injury to "vendors", that is, to the members of the association, who organized such weddings; members of association were "subject to sanction and loss of license for violation of the [regulations]", making them "a proper party in interest...." 682 F.3d 789 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs lacked standing, where they asserted that the cabotage provisions of the Jones Act violated the commerce clause.

<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff was without standing, where plaintiff sought to enjoin State and city and county of Honolulu from implementation or enforcement of any and all state statutes and city ordinances that might apply to the business that plaintiff claimed to be developing, involving a commercial boating activity on the Ala Wai canal. 57 F.

<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff, disabled individual who required a wheelchair to gain mobility, met constitutional minimum of Article III standing to seek injunctive relief for alleged Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 violations plaintiff encountered at fast food franchised restaurant and had standing to sue for injunctive relief for barriers not initially encountered; plaintiff's claims not specifically related to nonmobility denied due to lack of standing. 96 F. Supp. 2d 1065.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Department of education's appeal of hearing officer's award of compensatory education moot; student had already received award of three months of compensatory education and had already graduated from high school. 127 F. Supp. 2d 1103.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's appeal of plaintiff's claim for compensatory education granted, where appeal of hearing officer's award moot; among other things, plaintiff had received a high school diploma. 127 F. Supp. 2d 1117.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendants' issuance of supplemental environmental assessment for routine training at Makua Military Reservation and PFC Pililaau Range Complex (SEA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) constituted a final agency action ripe for judicial review at commencement of litigation under Administrative Procedure Act; plaintiff's claims had not been rendered moot by defendants' voluntary withdrawal of SEA and FONSI. 136 F. Supp. 2d 1155.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff challenging constitutionality of article XII of state constitution insofar as it created Hawaiian Homes Commission and office of Hawaiian affairs and established native Hawaiian gathering rights, lacked standing, where, inter alia, as to OHA's programs, plaintiff had not suffered injury-in-fact. 188 F.

<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiffs, seeking an order enjoining the executive director of the campaign spending commission, the commission, and the commissioners from taking any action adverse to plaintiffs, had not demonstrated a case or controversy for Article III purposes, court dismissed complaint for lack of jurisdiction and denied plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction as moot. 199 F. Supp. 2d 1018.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs alleging systemic harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth at a secure juvenile correctional facility, as well as differential treatment by staff and administrators, had standing to seek injunctive relief; one plaintiff's claims had become moot where there was no realistic possibility that the plaintiff would be returned to the facility. 415 F. Supp. 2d 1129.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff, a nonprofit health maintenance organization, satisfied Article III's case or controversy requirement; among other things, plaintiff alleged a concrete and particularized injury in its failure to obtain a contract under the QUEST expanded access program. 567 F. Supp. 2d 1238 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs had standing to challenge §11-358 where each plaintiff had had a legitimate desire to make a contribution or contributions that would exceed the statutory limitations pursuant to §11-358 to a committee that made only independent expenditures; such a situation gave rise to an actual controversy. 744 F. Supp. 2d 1075 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Claimant, as an unsecured creditor, did not have Article III standing to challenge the forfeiture of debtor's property, assuming that the defendant's money orders were purchased solely from the proceeds of the sale of debtor's property. 780 F. Supp. 2d 1084 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant insurance company's motion for judgment on the pleadings granted, inter alia, where insurance policy only covered some property in the individual units if the condo association agreement required the association of apartment owners (AOAO) to provide such insurance; policy did not state that the individual unit owners thereby became insureds who may bring claims against defendant on their own; that is, even if policy expanded what defendant covered for the AOAO, it did not necessarily follow that plaintiffs may themselves enforce the policy; in effect, plaintiffs had no standing to sue. 836 F. Supp. 2d 1117 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant insurance company's motion for judgment on the pleadings granted, inter alia, where the court was not persuaded that, by explicitly mentioning §514B-143(a)(1) while remaining silent as to §514B-143(b) in §514B-143(f), the legislature was giving a unit owner a private right of action under §514B-143(b); it could just as easily be said that the legislature's failure to mention any direct action by a unit owner indicated an intent not to permit such an action at all; in effect, plaintiffs had no standing to sue. 836 F. Supp. 2d 1117 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff physician, in plaintiff's individual capacity and in plaintiff's capacity as manager of defendant LLC, did not have standing to pursue claims on behalf of the other five physicians who were either equity members or employees of the LLC; a court may deny standing to a party because of prudential limitations on the standing doctrine which "include a requirement that the plaintiff assert [plaintiff's] own rights, rather than rely on the rights or interests of a third party". 861 F. Supp. 2d 1170 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff donors to political action committee had standing to challenge §11-358; they desired to and eventually made contributions that exceeded the statutory limitations, giving rise to an actual controversy; further, if §11-358 was constitutional as applied, they could have been subject to administrative fines or criminal prosecution; moreover, they indicated a legitimate desire to make similar contributions in 2012, and thus a favorable ruling would have allowed them to make further contributions in 2012 without violating the law. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor had standing to challenge the "advertising" disclaimer requirements in §11-391(a)(2)(B); first, even if plaintiff had already published advertisements with the disclaimers, it did not mean that it faced no injury; second, plaintiff sought a declaration that it need not include disclaimers in the future and challenged those statutes facially; third, plaintiff did not have to publish the advertisements without the disclaimers to have standing; finally, a favorable ruling would have enabled plaintiff to publish its advertisements without the disclaimers and fear of violating the law. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor had standing to challenge the contribution restrictions on government contractors in §11-355, given that plaintiff was a government contractor, had made substantial contributions to candidates in the past, and sought to make future contributions while it was a contractor; moreover, plaintiff did not have to violate the statute to challenge its terms, and a favorable ruling would have allowed plaintiff to make contributions as a contractor without violating the law. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff noncandidate committee and government contractor had standing to challenge the "noncandidate committee" and "expenditure" definitions in §11-302, where plaintiff had a good faith basis for believing it should not have to register as a noncandidate committee, giving rise to an actual controversy; if plaintiff ceased registration, but engaged in campaign related activities, it could have subjected itself to possible fines or actions; moreover, a favorable ruling would have allowed plaintiff to cease registration without violating the law. 872 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs asserting that Hawaii's marriage laws were unconstitutional, had standing to seek relief from defendant governor; governor was a proper party in the case. 884 F. Supp. 2d 1065 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff had not alleged an injury in fact, where plaintiff only alleged that plaintiff faced potential tax liability and penalties as a result of defendants' alleged violations of federal and state tax laws. It was possible to cure the defects in the amended count by amendment, if plaintiff could allege that plaintiff faced actual or imminent tax liabilities or penalties as a result of defendant's alleged violations of federal and state tax laws. 23 F. Supp. 3d 1152 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendants asserted that plaintiff lacked standing to bring a lawsuit because plaintiff was precluded from obtaining firearms under §134-7 and, therefore, could not establish a violation of plaintiff's Second Amendment rights, police department's denial of plaintiff's application for a firearms permit, order to surrender firearms plaintiff possessed, and letter affirming the denial of the application, constituted an "injury-in-fact" sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of Article III standing. 49 F. Supp. 3d 727 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Employees' retirement system (ERS) trustees had standing as fiduciaries of the system and its members to challenge legislation that would impair the ERS where, because of the legislature's diversion of excess investment earnings to reduction of employer contributions, ERS had continued to suffer a large unfunded actuarial liability, at the very core of the dispute was the impact of Act 100, L 1999 on the viability of the system, and injunctive relief would provide assurance that the legislature would honor its representations that excess investment earnings would be retained by the ERS. 114 H. 302, 162 P.3d 696.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs did not have standing where they failed to allege an "actual or threatened injury"; argument that impairing the employees' retirement system by removing "actuarial investment earnings in excess of a ten per cent investment yield rate" to be credited against employer contributions required for 1997 and 1998 would ultimately affect all members of the employees' retirement system was "abstract, conjectural, or merely hypothetical" with respect to each individual plaintiff. 114 H. 302, 162 P.3d 696.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs, retired and current employees challenging the State's removal of excess earnings from the retirement system, did not have standing where they were unable to show that they had "not received any pension benefit to which he or she was entitled", nor were they able to show any "immediate threat that the pension fund would become insolvent". 114 H. 302, 162 P.3d 696.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff-county, acting on behalf of the county council, had standing to maintain action where it (1) sufficiently alleged a threatened injury--the usurpation of the county council's taxing authority, (2) the council's threatened injury was fairly traceable to the defendants' duty to enforce the charter amendment, and (3) a favorable decision of invalidating the charter amendment would likely have provided relief for the threatened injury. 115 H. 15, 165 P.3d 916.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where taxpayers failed to allege an injury-in-fact with regard to the Hawaiian homes commission acts native Hawaiian ancestry qualification for homestead leases, they did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the tax exemptions for homestead lessees or the Hawaiian homes commission act generally. 128 H. 89, 283 P.3d 695 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Clause 2 did not grant original jurisdiction to U.S. Supreme Court in a case between a state and one of its own citizens; additionally, original jurisdiction did not lie in the U.S. Supreme Court because the instant case involved state penal statutes and was not civil in nature. 77 H. 222 (App.), 883 P.2d 644.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiff failed to demonstrate in plaintiff's complaint "such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant plaintiff's invocation of the court's jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court's remedial powers on plaintiff's behalf," plaintiff lacked standing to challenge two city zoning and development ordinances. 96 H. 134 (App.), 28 P.3d 350.</p>
