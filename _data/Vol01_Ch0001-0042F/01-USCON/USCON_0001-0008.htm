<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Commerce.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Fifth Amendment's takings clause precludes federal government from exercising commerce clause authority to promote navigation. 444 U.S. 164.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Liquor tax exemption for okolehao and pineapple wine violated commerce clause because it had both purpose and effect of discriminating in favor of local products. 468 U.S. 263.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Lagoon formed from littoral Hawaiian fishpond was incapable of use as continuous highway for purpose of navigation in interstate commerce, not subject to federal navigational servitude. 944 F.2d 1489.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No commerce clause violation by state anchoring and mooring regulations where state's interest in having regulations for public safety is substantial and there is little burden on interstate commerce. 42 F.3d 1185.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant argued that Congress exceeded its authority under commerce clause when it enacted 21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1), i.e., defendant contended, inter alia, that possession of a controlled substance is not necessarily a commercial activity that may be regulated under commerce clause, defendant's commerce clause argument lacked merit. 94 F.3d 1247.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant who entered conditional guilty pleas to two counts of illegal possession of a firearm, contended that 18 U.S.C. §922(g), as applied to defendant, represented an unconstitutional extension of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce, and that §922(g) could not be justified as having a substantial effect on interstate commerce, district court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss on commerce clause grounds affirmed. 479 F.3d 1153.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs lacked standing where they asserted that the cabotage provisions of the Jones Act violated the commerce clause; even if plaintiffs established standing, they would still fail to state a claim. The commerce clause does not limit Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce and plaintiffs' complaint was aimed squarely at a regulation of commerce among the several states, specifically shipping between Hawaii and the other states. 795 F.3d 1012 (2015).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Airline engaged in interstate and foreign commerce subject to suit in Hawaii. 253 F. Supp. 588.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Control share acquisition law is unconstitutional because it directly burdens interstate commerce and its indirect burden on commerce outweighs its benefits. 643 F. Supp. 161.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Congress is provided with the exclusive authority to regulate the nation's waterways. 725 F. Supp. 1509.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's motion to dismiss indictment alleging that defendant violated 18 U.S.C. §922(g) by possessing a rifle and ammunition while being an unlawful user of a controlled substance denied, where defendant argued that the statute, as applied to the facts of the case, was an unconstitutional exercise of Congress' commerce clause authority. 351 F. Supp. 2d 1045.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to raise a question of fact as to whether the seasonal ban on parasailing imposed clearly excessive burdens on interstate commerce. 380 F. Supp. 2d 1160.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff fireworks company was unlikely to succeed on the merits in alleging that a Honolulu city ordinance, prohibiting the importation of consumer fireworks into Honolulu, violated the commerce clause; the city's interest in the safety of its citizens reasonably outweighs any incidental impact on interstate commerce; also, the commerce clause does not protect plaintiff's method of operation in a retail market. 796 F. Supp. 2d 1261 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Not all burdens imposed by a state upon commerce, but only undue or discriminatory ones, are forbidden. 46 H. 269, 379 P.2d 336; 48 H. 486, 405 P.2d 382.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> General excise tax on commissions received by travel agencies does not offend the commerce clause if (1) it does not discriminate against interstate commerce, (2) it is fairly apportioned so as to cover only income attributable to activity within state, (3) it does not subject interstate commerce to cumulative taxation. 53 H. 419, 495 P.2d 1172.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> A tax upon out-of-state company's income based upon leased telecast rights exercisable only in Hawaii held not unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. 57 H. 175, 554 P.2d 242.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where comparison between out-of-state taxpayer and its in-state counterpart shows tax advantage to the former, such taxpayer has no ground to complain that use tax violates the commerce clause. 58 H. 163, 566 P.2d 1091.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Imposition of public service company tax on interisland air carrier was not undue burden on commerce. 65 H. 1, 647 P.2d 263.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No violation in exempting certain locally produced products from liquor tax. 65 H. 566, 656 P.2d 724.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No violation of commerce clause by Hawaii's imposition of general excise tax on Delaware corporation which sold books to the state library where corporation's presence in Hawaii was a continuous process of sales and service creating a substantial legal nexus with Hawaii, and tax was "internally" and "externally" consistent for fair apportionment of taxable income. 103 H. 359, 82 P.3d 804.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Challenge to the validity of §707-756, electronic enticement of a child in the first degree, under the doctrine of the dormant commerce clause was without merit, as the electronic enticement statutory prohibition does not interfere with, or does not involve, interstate commerce. 134 H. 515, 345 P.3d 181 (2015).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Section 707-756 does not concern interstate commerce, and therefore, scrutiny under the commerce clause was not appropriate. Assuming, arguendo, that §707-756 warranted commerce clause scrutiny, the section does not violate the dormant commerce clause. 131 H. 312 (App.), 318 P.3d 602 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Naturalization.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> The Welfare Reform Act established a uniform federal structure for providing welfare benefits to distinct classes of aliens. The entire benefit scheme flows from these classifications; a state's limited discretion to implement a plan for a specified category of aliens does not defeat or undermine uniformity. 748 F.3d 875 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The limited discretion authorized to states for the third category of aliens established by the Welfare Reform Act, which included Compact of Free Association residents, did not undermine the uniformity requirement of the naturalization clause. 797 F.3d 572 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Necessary and proper.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Migratory Bird Treaty Act was upheld by Supreme Court under necessary and proper clause and Article II treaty-making power. 103 F.3d 1475.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Treaty power coupled with the necessary and proper clause provided Congress with an additional source of authority to apply federal statute beyond U.S. borders. 525 F.3d 709.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Respondent contended that Congress exceeded its authority in enacting 18 U.S.C. §4248 of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act as applied to persons, like respondent, who are in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, but whose sentences have expired; Congress did not exceed its authority in enacting a civil commitment scheme that applies to persons in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. 574 F. Supp. 2d 1123 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Taxing and spending.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Allegation that State improperly administers unemployment compensation program is not sufficient to confer standing to challenge federal contributions to state program. 691 F.2d 905.</p>
