<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Generally.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant has constitutional right to have all stages of a criminal trial conducted by a person with jurisdiction to preside. 42 F.3d 473.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No violation of defendant's due process right to a fair trial by prosecution's refusal to reveal exact dates of confidential informant's observations as exact dates were not necessary in order for defendant to challenge district court's findings of probable cause. 88 H. 396, 967 P.2d 228.</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Seven-day failure to comply with time requirements for filing criminal appeal does not preclude right to appeal. 2 H. App. 606, 638 P.2d 338.</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Compulsory process.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> District court erred in excluding defense expert witness as sanction for asserted violation of discovery rule where no discovery violation occurred. 937 F.2d 1422.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> A sentencing increase based on defendant's false testimony does not unconstitutionally burden defendant's right to testify. 1 F.3d 1523; 35 F.3d 1275.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant contended that pursuant to constitutional right to testify, district court was required to permit defendant to explain to jury that defendant behaved in manner that defendant did because defendant was acting under duress, whether or not defendant had demonstrated prima facie evidence of duress, since proposed testimony pertained to a defense that was not relevant as a matter of law, the district court did not err in excluding the evidence during the trial. 102 F.3d 994.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant only afforded right to compel attendance and testimony of witnesses who can give relevant and beneficial testimony for defense. 64 H. 217, 638 P.2d 324; 67 H. 59, 677 P.2d 465.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> A trial court must pass on a defendant's attempted withdrawal of the prior waiver of his or her right to testify, tendered before the commencement of closing arguments, pursuant to the "liberal approach", whereas such an attempted withdrawal tendered thereafter is subject to the "manifest injustice" standard. 88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant did not meet burden of establishing plausible and legitimate reasons for withdrawal of defendant's prior waiver of defendant's right to testify, defendant failed to present "fair and just reasons" for defendant's request to exercise defendant's right to testify in defendant's own behalf; thus trial court did not abuse discretion by ruling that it would not reopen case. 88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where trial court's denial of defendant's post-verdict motion for a new trial--based on defendant's claim that defendant's attempt to withdraw defendant's waiver of right to testify in defendant's own behalf should have been allowed--was not "manifestly unjust", no abuse of discretion. 88 H. 407, 967 P.2d 239.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where witness appeared, exercised witness' right to remain silent, and defendant failed to offer proof beyond conjecture that witness' testimony would be helpful to defendant, defendant's right not violated. 100 H. 210, 58 P.3d 1257.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Court's ruling that evidence of defendant's juvenile proceedings could be admissible violated §571-84(h) and constituted reversible error, where ruling was a reason defendant decided not to testify, infringed on defendant's constitutional right to testify, and there was a reasonable possibility that the court's error might have contributed to defendant's conviction. 127 H. 432, 279 P.3d 1237 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Advisement by the family court did not adequately ascertain whether petitioner understood petitioner's constitutional right to testify or not to testify, as required by the Hawaii supreme court in Tachibana v. State. Moreover, petitioner's need for an interpreter during the trial was a "salient fact" heightening the necessity for the court to insure that petitioner understood the rights petitioner waived. Accordingly, the court did not obtain a valid on-the-record waiver of petitioner's right to testify. 130 H. 83, 306 P.3d 128 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the district court's ultimate Tachibana colloquy was defective because it incompletely advised defendant of defendant's right to testify and because it did not establish that defendant understood defendant's rights, the district court did not obtain an on-the-record waiver of the right to testify from defendant; defendant demonstrated a constitutional violation of defendant's right to testify, which could not be considered harmless. 132 H. 85, 319 P.3d 1093 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where inmate was transported to the courthouse upon being subpoenaed to testify but refused to testify, circuit court did not violate defendant's right to compulsory process by denying defendant's request to extract the inmate so that the inmate could refuse to testify in front of the jury. 133 H. 253, 327 P.3d 931 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Refusal of court to permit defendant at an identification suppression hearing to examine the identification witness was not violative of constitutional rights. 1 H. App. 335, 619 P.2d 1078.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Constitutional right to present character evidence no greater than right under Hawaii Rules of Evidence. 5 H. App. 251, 687 P.2d 554.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's constitutional and statutory right to testify in defendant's own defense was violated where judge reproached defendant to follow defendant's attorney's advice and thus refrain from testifying, and the violation was plain error; denial of the right to testify was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court did not violate defendant's due process and Sixth Amendment rights to compulsory process to present a favorable defense witness when it ordered witness to wear western clothing when testifying, thus precluding witness from wearing only a malo and a kihei; to the extent that the effect of the western-Hawaiian clothing combination was bizarre, insulting and undermined the value of the witness' testimony, those consequences were caused by the witness opting for that combination and could not be used by defendant to vacate the jury's verdict. 106 H. 43 (App.), 101 P.3d 652.</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Confrontation of witnesses.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Not violated by court's refusal to admit prosecution witness' shoplifting conviction. 789 F.2d 1425.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> When substantial cross-examination has taken place, the courts are less inclined to find a violation of the right to confrontation. 819 F.2d 227.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where trial court asked defense counsel to designate one attorney to conduct "main" cross-examination into basic issues, and expressly allowed all defense attorneys to cross-examine as to issues particular to their own clients, appellants failed to show how court's requirement limited any relevant testimony or caused them prejudice. 127 F.3d 791.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant argued that statute (18 U.S.C. §3509) setting forth procedure by which an alleged child victim can testify outside of physical presence of defendant via two-way closed circuit television violated the confrontation clause, statute (1) not unconstitutional; and (2) does not require that television monitor in witness room be located directly in child's field of vision while child testifies. 328 F.3d 493.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Waiver, when effective. 51 H. 99, 451 P.2d 806.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Includes the right of cross-examination. 51 H. 125, 453 P.2d 221.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Right not necessarily violated by admission of business records as exception to hearsay rule. 53 H. 466, 497 P.2d 575.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Admissibility of transcripts of witness' testimony at preliminary hearing. 54 H. 637, 513 P.2d 697.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Sufficiency of proof of unavailability of witness to permit introduction of transcript of pre-trial testimony. 55 H. 346, 519 P.2d 1241.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Admission of oral confession of a defendant implicating a co-defendant violates confrontation rights of the co-defendant. 58 H. 299, 568 P.2d 504.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Not violated by evidence admissible under exception to hearsay rule, provided statement is found to be reliable. 62 H. 518, 616 P.2d 1383.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's right of cross-examination may not be unduly restricted but it has never been held to be absolutely without restriction. 62 H. 572, 617 P.2d 1214.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Admission of stipulation of testimony of State's witness was not a denial of the right of confrontation. 62 H. 646, 618 P.2d 1142.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Waiver of right by defendant's counsel. 63 H. 186, 623 P.2d 881.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Entry of stipulated testimony into evidence without determining knowing and intelligent waiver. 64 H. 187, 637 P.2d 778.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Unavailability of witness; good faith effort to secure appearance. 65 H. 286, 651 P.2d 470.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant claiming confrontation rights violated had no standing to challenge admission of co-defendant's illegally obtained confession. 68 H. 569, 722 P.2d 1036.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Redacted statement of nontestifying co-defendant did not violate confrontation clause. 70 H. 219, 768 P.2d 230.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No violation where the State made a good faith effort to locate witness. 70 H. 343, 771 P.2d 509.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Criminal defendant's right to be present at all stages of trial cannot be waived by counsel. 73 H. 97, 828 P.2d 280.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Error for trial court to refuse to permit a defense witness to testify as penalty for violating witness exclusion rule. 73 H. 331, 832 P.2d 269.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Right not violated by defendant's absence from conference settling jury instructions as conference does not involve jury's presence or witness testimony. 74 H. 141, 838 P.2d 1374.</p>
<p class="XNotes">Admission of co-defendant's testimony concerning incriminatory out-of-court statements made against defendant did not violate defendant's rights to confront defendant's accuser under the U.S. or Hawaii Constitutions. 76 H. 148, 871 P.2d 782.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Circuit court's limitation of appellant's cross-examination of witness did not violate appellant's right to confront witnesses against appellant where appellant adequately raised issue of witness' possible bias. 78 H. 383, 894 P.2d 80.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Prior to introduction of videotaped interview, cross-examination of complainant sex assault victim regarding complainant's conversation with police officer satisfied defendant's right of confrontation. 80 H. 107, 905 P.2d 613.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Not violated by admission of declarant's former testimony under HRE rule 804(b)(1) where prosecution established declarant's unavailability, that it had made good faith efforts to secure declarant's presence, and reliability of statement was shown. 82 H. 202, 921 P.2d 122.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Abuse of discretion where trial court excluded evidence of complainant's prior conviction, by prohibiting cross-examination of complainant, from which jury could have inferred that complainant had a motive to bring false charges against defendant and give false testimony at trial. 83 H. 109, 924 P.2d 1215.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Right violated as prosecution witness not "unavailable" under HRE rule 804(a)(5); prosecution's good faith efforts require a search equally as vigorous as that which it would undertake to find a critical witness if it had no prior testimony to rely upon in the event of unavailability. 83 H. 267, 925 P.2d 1091.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Right not violated where trial court allowed defense adequate opportunity to raise issue of witness' possible bias while imposing modest restriction on defense's cross-examination of witness to avoid risk of prejudicing jury. 83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Admission into evidence of witness' grand jury testimony under HRE rule 802.1(4), past recollection recorded hearsay exception, did not violate defendant's right where witness' testimony was supported by numerous guarantees of trustworthiness and defendant was able to cross-examine witness on witness' subsequent failure to remember alleged incident. 92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Admission into evidence of witness' handwritten statement on the bottom of an identification form, under HRE rule 802.1(4), past recollection recorded hearsay exception, did not violate defendant's right where witness' statement was supported by numerous guarantees of trustworthiness. 92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where prior inconsistent statements were properly admitted under HRE rule 802.1(1)(C) and witnesses were cross-examined with respect to their statements, substantive use of these statements did not violate defendant's confrontation rights. 92 H. 61, 987 P.2d 959.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where jury had sufficient information to gauge adequately witness' credibility and to appraise witness' motivation to fabricate testimony against defendant, trial court did not abuse discretion in limiting scope of defendant's cross-examination of witness. 92 H. 192, 990 P.2d 90.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Right not violated by trial court's imposition of certain restrictions on scope of defense counsel's cross-examination where (1) there was no reasonable possibility that the cross-examination would have changed the outcome of defendant's trial; (2) witness' second forgery conviction on recross examination was beyond the scope of redirect examination; and (3) defense counsel's inquiring into the location of a map given to witness by defendant was not relevant. 99 H. 390, 56 P.3d 692.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> When a statutory privilege interferes with a defendant's constitutional right to cross-examine, then, upon a sufficient showing by the defendant, the witness' statutory privilege must, in the interest of the truth-seeking process, bow to the defendant's constitutional rights. 101 H. 172, 65 P.3d 119.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As there is no exception under HRE rule 804(b)(8) for pending or anticipated litigation, such that statements by victim-wife would have been admissible even if a divorce proceeding had actually been underway, trial court did not abuse discretion in determining hearsay statements were trustworthy; however, trial court abused discretion in admitting statements in violation of defendant's constitutional right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. 103 H. 89, 79 P.3d 1263.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where trial court prohibited all inquiry into the complainant's alleged motive or bias for faking injury, petitioner's right of confrontation under this Amendment and article I, §14 of the Hawaii constitution was violated; appellate court erred and case remanded for new trial. 106 H. 116, 102 P.3d 360.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant would not have likely been acquitted, witness was not the only witness to the event, and the conviction did not rest on the witness' credibility alone, trial court's preclusion of defendant's questioning of witness regarding witness' motives for changing witness' mind about testifying was harmless error. 109 H. 314, 126 P.3d 357.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where, pursuant to HRE rule 404(b), defendant was required to give prosecution reasonable notice prior to introducing rule 404(b) evidence, it did not violate defendant's constitutional right to present a defense and examine witnesses; rule 404(b) is not per se unconstitutional even though it may restrict a defendant's constitutional right to confront an adverse witness and rule 404(b)'s policy of reducing surprise and promoting early resolution on the issue of admissibility justified the limitation imposed on the defendant's constitutional right to testify. 118 H. 452, 193 P.3d 368.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The admission into evidence, as a business record under HRE rule 803(b)(6), of a speed check card for which a proper foundation was established, would not have violated defendant's Sixth Amendment<b> </b>rights; the speed check card was created in a non-adversarial setting in the regular course of maintaining the officer's vehicle five months prior to the alleged speeding incident and was therefore non-testimonial in nature. 122 H. 354, 227 P.3d 520 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's right violated where court did not allow defendant to cross-examine complainant about complainant's alleged theft of defendant's credit cards; had defendant been allowed to cross-examine, defendant might have succeeded in eliciting testimony from complainant tending to show that complainant was biased or had a motive to fabricate or exaggerate the story about harassment and to testify falsely in court, which in turn could have affected the court's view of complainant's credibility and that the State had not proven its case. 128 H. 34, 282 P.3d 576 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where a defendant has expressed an intention to be absent from the proceedings and the court has the opportunity to address the defendant, trial courts should advise a defendant of the constitutional rights that will be lost upon exiting a courtroom; by engaging defendants in this manner, the trial courts seek to ensure that a defendant makes an informed decision not to be present. 128 H. 479, 291 P.3d 377 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Face to face confrontation is preferred; prosecution failed to show unavailability of the witness. 7 H. App. 80, 742 P.2d 986.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Not violated in DUI case by admission into evidence of log showing breath-testing instrument had been tested for accuracy. 9 H. App. 130, 828 P.2d 813.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Admission into evidence of redacted confessions of defendants-spouses violated defendants-spouses' confrontational rights. 10 H. App. 43, 861 P.2d 24.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court erred in limiting questioning regarding complainant's financial situation and relationship with fiance; error not harmless. 79 H. 255 (App.), 900 P.2d 1322.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant entitled to elicit evidence of complainant's past sexual behavior, not to attack complainant's character, but to determine whether complainant was mentally defective and whether defendant knew that complainant was mentally defective. 81 H. 447 (App.), 918 P.2d 254.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Clause not violated where questions defendant wanted to ask police officer regarding officer's "motive", and "knowledge of how much cocaine a drug addict would consume" were not relevant to any issue in case. 82 H. 499 (App.), 923 P.2d 916.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's right to confrontation violated where family court admitted girls' statements, which were "testimonial" hearsay, and the girls were neither unavailable nor subject at any time to cross-examination concerning their statements; as error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction, judgment vacated and remanded. 107 H. 133 (App.), 111 P.3d 28.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court erred by not allowing defendant to introduce evidence of, and cross-examine victim as to victim's drug use and addiction at or near the time of the incident to the extent that it affected victim's perception or recollection of the alleged event, and defendant was not required to present expert testimony to that effect. 108 H. 102 (App.), 117 P.3d 834.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where, even in the absence of a plea agreement, witness' pending sentencing in two other criminal matters were relevant and probative of a potential bias or motive for testifying in favor of the State, trial court erred in denying defendant's motion in limine with respect to evidence of witness' pending sentencing, and error was not harmful beyond a reasonable doubt as State's case was based on jury finding that witness' testimony was credible and believing the witness over the defendant. 108 H. 102 (App.), 117 P.3d 834.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where sworn statements made by police intoxilyzer supervisor admitted into evidence pursuant to HRE rule 803(b)(8) as public records could not be considered "testimonial" hearsay, the statements were not subject to the requirements of this Amendment; thus, no showing of the supervisor's unavailability nor a prior opportunity for cross-examination was required prior to admission. 114 H. 396 (App.), 163 P.3d 199.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As the right of confrontation is not absolute, circuit court properly ruled that defendant was not entitled to introduce selected portions of witness' statement that were favorable to defendant's defense and at the same time preclude the State from introducing other portions of witness' statement that were necessary to prevent the jury from being misled; thus, circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the responsive portions of witness' statement offered by the State were admissible under HRE rule 106 and rule 403. 125 H. 462 (App.), 264 P.3d 40 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where State offered as an exhibit a letter signed by the supervising driver license clerk certifying that defendant did not have a valid driver's license on the "violation date", and the supervising driver license clerk did not testify at trial, the exhibit was a testimonial statement and the district court's admission of the exhibit violated defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights. 134 H. 465 (App.), 342 P.3d 884 (2015).</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Impartial jury.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Jury instructions did not invade province of jury as finders of fact. Not violated by extrajudicial communication between juror and prosecutor regarding matter unrelated to trial. 730 F.2d 1292.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Excusal of college students from venire did not violate right to jury fairly representing cross-section of community since college students did not qualify as cognizable group. 965 F.2d 781.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Though prosecutor's remarks were of questionable relevance and conveyed repugnant images, reversal justified only where alleged prosecutorial misconduct materially affects verdict or deprives defendant of fair trial. 1 F.3d 1523.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Habeas corpus granted due to jury misconduct. 677 F. Supp. 1061.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's motion for new trial denied where defendant argued, inter alia, that new trial was necessary because juror failed to honestly answer a material question during voir dire. 101 F. Supp. 2d 1304.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Scope of voir dire of prospective jurors in case of extensive pretrial publicity. 55 H. 640, 526 P.2d 94.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Effect of news accounts prejudicial to defendant; protective measures required of trial court. 58 H. 356, 569 P.2d 891.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court's supplemental instruction to deadlocked jury that it must unanimously decide that it was unable to reach verdict was prejudicial. 72 H. 327, 817 P.2d 1054.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court must insure that defendant's right to fair trial is not compromised and at the least prevent or reduce prejudicial pretrial publicity; order imposing restrictions on extrajudicial statements of trial participants was impermissible. 73 H. 499, 835 P.2d 637.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Circuit court did not commit an abuse of discretion in granting defendant's motion for new trial; circuit court's conclusions of law that possible juror misconduct at voir dire and juror misconduct during deliberations deprived defendant of a trial by twelve fair and impartial jurors not clearly erroneous. 76 H. 172, 873 P.2d 51.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Newscast concerning appellants and their alleged involvement in a burglary other than those charged and prospective juror's account of the newscast and the effect it had on prospective juror that was given in presence of jury panel, discussed as "outside influences". 78 H. 383, 894 P.2d 80.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Not violated by empaneling of anonymous jury where there was strong reason to believe jury needed protection and trial court took reasonable steps to minimize any prejudicial effect on defendant and ensure that defendant's fundamental rights were protected. 83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Purpose of §612-18(c) is to uphold a criminal defendant's constitutional guarantees of a presumption of innocence and an impartial jury. 83 H. 507, 928 P.2d 1.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's right not violated by having husband and wife serve on same jury; both expressly stated during voir dire that they would each make their own decisions and would not automatically go along with the other person. 88 H. 19, 960 P.2d 1227.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> References to race that do not have an objectively legitimate purpose constitute a particularly egregious form of prosecutorial misconduct. 91 H. 405, 984 P.2d 1231.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where there was a reasonable possibility that prosecutor's comment during closing argument might have contributed to defendant's conviction, prosecutor's comment constituted prosecutorial misconduct that denied defendant right to a fair trial. 91 H. 405, 984 P.2d 1231.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Given that any improper remarks in opening statement, closing and rebuttal arguments by prosecutor were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and their cumulative effect was similarly harmless and did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, prosecutor's misconduct did not warrant reversal of any of defendant's convictions and did not implicate the double jeopardy clauses of either the U.S. or Hawaii Constitutions. 95 H. 465, 24 P.3d 661.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although prosecutor's remark that the reasonable doubt standard "was never meant to provide a shield for a guilty man" had the potential to invite the jury to misapply and erode the standard, and was thus improper, where the trial court immediately corrected the prosecutor and issued a curative instruction, and verdicts suggested that the jury was not unduly swayed by the isolated remark in the two week trial and gave proper consideration to all relevant circumstances, improper comment not reversible error. 98 H. 1, 41 P.3d 157.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's right not violated where defendant did not assert or show that a "distinctive group" was underrepresented in the pool of potential jurors initially selected in the case. 98 H. 1, 41 P.3d 157.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant failed to satisfy defendant's burden of establishing a prima facie showing that the possibility of juror misconduct could have substantially prejudiced defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion for a new trial. 103 H. 285, 81 P.3d 1200.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where, even if juror was sleeping and did not hear a portion of defense counsel's closing argument, juror was given correct instruction, and presumably juror followed it; thus, based on the totality of circumstances, the prosecution met its burden in establishing that the alleged deprivation of the right to a fair trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 108 H. 474, 122 P.3d 254.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where juror nine's statement that defendant had "been in trouble before" concerned a highly inflammatory and prejudicial prior crime that had been ruled inadmissible, and the circuit court had instructed the jury to disregard the statement, the evidence was not so overwhelming as to outweigh the prejudice of juror nine's statement; thus, when viewed with the trial evidence and statements of other jurors during voir dire, juror nine's statements were insurmountably prejudicial, there was a reasonable possibility that it contributed to defendant's conviction, and the circuit court abused its discretion in denying a motion for a new trial. 126 H. 383, 271 P.3d 1142 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where record did not reflect that the jury was informed of the act that corresponded to each count, and the family court was required to provide the jury with a specific unanimity instruction, and its failure to do so constituted error, because the one-to-one relationship between counts and acts was made clear to the jury, and the jury found defendant guilty on nineteen counts for which nineteen exhibits were presented at trial, there was no genuine possibility that different jurors concluded that the defendant committed different acts; thus, error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 127 H. 20, 276 P.3d 589 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant was present when the trial court read the newspaper publicity statement to prospective jurors, and could have, but did not, object to the court's reading of the statement, appeals court did not err in concluding that defendant forfeited defendant's objection concerning the publicity statement. 127 H. 91, 276 P.3d 660 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where, (1) as an officer of the court, counsel was bound to respect the law as embodied in the jury instructions, and counsel's argument to the jurors encouraged disdain for the law, (2) no curative instruction was given by the court, and (3) the evidence in the case was not so overwhelming as to outweigh the effect of the misconduct, there was a reasonable possibility that prosecutor's improper remarks might have contributed to defendant's conviction and were thus not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 127 H. 432, 279 P.3d 1237 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where prosecutor advised the jury during closing argument that the jury instructions were "mumbo jumbo", that the jury instructions could be "put aside", and that the jurors could decide the question of guilt based on their "gut feeling", prosecutor's remarks constituted prosecutorial misconduct as the prosecutor reinforced the proposition that the jurors could disregard the law embodied in the instructions and improperly invited the jury to base its verdict on considerations other than the evidence in the case. 127 H. 432, 279 P.3d 1237 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Failure to inquire into circumstances of statement overheard by juror, and reliance on juror's own determination of ability to remain impartial while unaware of influences is reversible error. 2 H. App. 643, 639 P.2d 413.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Not violated by bailiff's statement to jury foreperson that jurors should all agree with verdict if polled. 6 H. App. 320, 721 P.2d 718.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where trial court found statements of jurors on voir dire credible, statements were sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that defendant was not denied an impartial jury. 85 H. 49 (App.), 936 P.2d 1297.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where State failed to rebut presumption of prejudice to defendant resulting from juror's improper investigation of details concerning defendant's welfare status, court properly granted motion for new trial. 89 H. 215 (App.), 971 P.2d 304.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plain error where trial court's answer to jury communication was prejudicially insufficient, misleading and affected defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous verdict as jury may have wrongly believed based on court's answer that if they failed to reach unanimous agreement as to the affirmative defense of entrapment, the defense was not applicable and a guilty verdict was required. 90 H. 489 (App.), 979 P.2d 85.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where prosecutor referred to defendants' race in opening statement, there was no curative instruction given to address the inflammatory comment, trial court overruled defense counsel's timely objection, and the case against defendants, which hinged on the credibility of complainant, was not so overwhelming as to outweigh the inflammatory comment, prosecutor's references to race might have contributed to the convictions of defendants; thus, convictions set aside. 98 H. 358 (App.), 48 P.3d 605.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's right to a fair trial not violated where the record in the case did not indicate that juror was incompetent, unable to understand the proceedings, and unable to participate in deliberations. 120 H. 94 (App.), 201 P.3d 607.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's sentence violated the Sixth Amendment, where defendant was sentenced under a mandatory sentencing regime, the district judge departed upward under a section of the U.S. sentencing guidelines based on judicially determined facts, and the actual sentence exceeded the maximum authorized at the time based solely on the jury's verdict. 425 F.3d 602.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Only if proceeding is criminal is right to jury dependent on magnitude of penalty imposed. 66 H. 461, 667 P.2d 783.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Driving while intoxicated is serious offense. 68 H. 38, 704 P.2d 883.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Waiver of right to jury trial cannot be presumed by silent record. 73 H. 217, 830 P.2d 512.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Because the record was silent as to any colloquy between court and defendant, counsel's waiver of client's right was invalid, violating defendant's right to trial by jury under Sixth Amendment and article I, §14 of Hawaii constitution. 75 H. 118, 857 P.2d 576.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No right to a jury trial for a first-offense DUI under §291-4, as amended by Act 128, L 1993. 76 H. 360, 878 P.2d 699.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where no term of imprisonment was authorized under §266-25 for violation of administrative rule regulating boat moorings, violation a presumptively petty offense for which right to jury trial did not attach; consideration of other relevant factors failed to overcome presumption. 84 H. 65, 929 P.2d 78.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under totality of facts and circumstances, defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived right to jury trial; defendant was aware of right, articulated to trial court the difference between a jury trial and judge trial, defendant's counsel stated counsel had explained difference to defendant, and defendant affirmatively indicated to trial court that waiver was voluntary and a result of defendant's own reflection. 93 H. 63, 996 P.2d 268.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> There is no constitutional right to a jury trial for a first-time driving under the influence of drugs offense under §291-7 (1993) as the offense is a "petty" and not "serious" offense. 97 H. 259, 36 P.3d 803.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where record indicated that trial court conducted a colloquy with defendant regarding defendant's right to a trial by jury and that defendant orally waived this right, defendant subsequently failed to overcome burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant's waiver of right to jury trial was involuntary. 99 H. 312, 55 P.3d 276.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment as a "multiple offender" pursuant to §706-662(4)(a); without this finding that the defendant committed a previous felony, notwithstanding that such an extended term may be considered "necessary for protection of the public", a judge would not be authorized to impose it; and extended term sentencing did not run afoul of this Amendment as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in Apprendi v. New Jersey. 110 H. 79, 129 P.3d 1107.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Inasmuch as §706-662 authorizes the sentencing court to extend a defendant's sentence beyond the "standard term" authorized solely by the jury's verdict by requiring the sentencing court, rather than the trier of fact, to make an additional necessity finding that does not fall under Apprendi's prior-or-concurrent-convictions exception, §706-662 is unconstitutional on its face; thus, defendant's extended term sentences imposed by the trial court violated defendant's right to a jury trial and were illegal. 115 H. 432, 168 P.3d 562.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Appeals court did not err in affirming trial court's imposition of a consecutive term of imprisonment for attempted first degree sex assault where none of defendant's other individual prison terms exceeded the statutory maximum for each applicable offense. 121 H. 339, 219 P.3d 1126 (2009).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Where trial judge failed to engage in a colloquy with defendant to ensure that the waiver of jury trial was intelligent, knowing and voluntary, and defendant's counsel did not represent in open court that defendant was aware of defendant's right to a jury trial, under the totality of circumstances, trial court failed to obtain a valid waiver of defendant's right to a jury trial. 98 H. 77 (App.), 42 P.3d 654.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under the totality of the circumstances, where defendant's express waiver of a jury trial was consistently clear, direct, and unequivocal throughout the entire colloquy, defendant orally waived right to trial by jury, and failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that this waiver was involuntary. 105 H. 160 (App.), 95 P.3d 14.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where maximum time in jail for a violation of a Hawaii administrative rule was thirty days and notwithstanding that defendant was subject to a possible maximum fine of $18,000, defendant's offense was "petty" for Sixth Amendment purposes; thus, defendant had no right to a jury trial under the U.S. Constitution. 105 H. 342 (App.), 97 P.3d 418.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Based on the totality of the circumstances, defendant failed to establish that the waiver of defendant's right to a jury trial was involuntary or improper; the family court's mass advisement, in conjunction with the family court's individualized colloquy of defendant, sufficiently apprised defendant of defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial, and defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived this right. 108 H. 300 (App.), 119 P.3d 608.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant did not have a constitutional right to a jury trial for a violation of §852-1, refusal to provide ingress or egress while walking a labor picket line, where the maximum punishment was thirty days in jail or a $200 fine, or both, and violation was thus a petty misdemeanor under §701-107(4). 110 H. 139 (App.), 129 P.3d 1167.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Manner in which defendant's family was excluded from courtroom violated defendant's right to a public trial. 91 H. 181, 981 P.2d 1127.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The right to a public trial is not implicated by the exclusion of a potential witness pursuant to the witness exclusionary rule; both the witness exclusionary rule and the right to a public trial ensure the appearance of fairness at trial; thus, defendant's right not violated by exclusion of defendant's father from the courtroom as a potential prosecution rebuttal witness. 97 H. 206, 35 P.3d 233.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's constitutional rights to a public trial were not implicated when the jury was allowed to deliberate, communicate, and return its verdict after normal business hours, when the courthouse was closed to the public, because the closure "was too trivial to implicate the constitutional guarantees". 112 H. 343 (App.), 145 P.3d 886.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Although prosecution's oral charge failed to include the word "bodily" to modify "injury", the omission did not alter the nature and cause of the accusation such that a person of common understanding would fail to comprehend it; thus, the oral charge was not so obviously defective that by no reasonable construction could it be said to charge the offense for which conviction was had; because omission of the word "bodily" did not constitute an essential element of the offense, harmless error. 99 H. 312, 55 P.3d 276.</p>

App. 447, 845 P.2d 1194.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The court's assumption of defense counsel's role by persuading defendant to relinquish defendant's right to testify was an interference with the attorney-client relationship protected by Sixth Amendment and article I, §14 of Hawaii constitution; the intervention by the court constituted plain error; the error was prejudicial and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 78 H. 115 (App.), 890 P.2d 702.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Right not violated by trial court's denial of defendant's motion to withdraw and substitute counsel as there was no good cause to warrant substitution where, despite being advised of its inadmissible nature, defendant insisted attorney proffer character evidence and character witnesses at trial, there was no "complete breakdown of trust and confidence" between attorney and defendant, and defendant elected to continue with attorney, without further protest, and did not aver that defendant wanted to go to trial pro se. 101 H. 112 (App.), 63 P.3d 420.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> The Hawaii paroling authority minimum-term hearing is a critical stage of the criminal proceeding and a convicted person is constitutionally entitled to be represented at the hearing by counsel; where defendant's rule 40 petition presented a colorable claim that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel at defendant's minimum-term hearing and did not knowingly and intelligently waive right to counsel, trial court erred in summarily denying the petition. 112 H. 446 (App.), 146 P.3d 606.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No ineffective assistance of counsel where consideration of all the circumstances, including a waiver by client of a conflict of interest on the part of client's attorney and a power of attorney to pay for attorney's legal services, showed that attorney did not have an actual conflict of interest between client's interest and attorney's interest. 126 H. 247 (App.), 269 P.3d 782 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No ineffective assistance of counsel where nothing in the record indicated that attorney's obligations extended any further than informing defendant that deportation was a possible consequence of defendant's no contest plea. 126 H. 541 (App.), 273 P.3d 1227 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the record supported the Hawaii paroling authority's (HPA) determination of punishment and defendant did not provide any valid basis to support a claim that the HPA's corrected minimum term order was constitutionally deficient, defendant did not show that counsel provided ineffective assistance. 134 H. 390 (App.), 341 P.3d 1190 (2014).</p>
