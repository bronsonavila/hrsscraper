The issuance of the notes and the details thereof shall be governed by the provisions of this part with respect to bonds insofar as the same may be applicable; provided that:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Each note, together with all renewals and extensions thereof, or refundings thereof by other notes issued pursuant to this section, shall mature within five years from the date of the original note; and</p>
