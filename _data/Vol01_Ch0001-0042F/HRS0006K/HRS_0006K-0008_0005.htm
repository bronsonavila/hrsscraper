Also for purposes of this section, "historic property" means any building, structure, object, districts, area, or site, including heiau and underwater site, which is over fifty years old.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Any criminal penalty for any violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under this chapter shall not be deemed to preclude the commission from bringing a civil legal action to recover additional administrative fines and costs. Any civil legal action against a person to recover administrative fines and costs for any violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under this chapter shall not be deemed to preclude the State from pursuing any criminal action against that person.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) In any judicial proceeding to recover an administrative penalty imposed, the commission need only show that notice was given, that a hearing was held or the time granted for requesting a hearing has run without such a request, that an administrative penalty was imposed, and that the administrative penalty remains unpaid.
