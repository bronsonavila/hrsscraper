<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง15D-<a name="_Toc273713761">14] Use of voter's electronic-mail address</a>.</b> (a) The local election official shall request an electronic-mail address from each covered voter who registers to vote after [July 1, 2012]. An electronic-mail address provided by a covered voter may not be made available to the public or any individual or organization other than an authorized agent of the local election official and is exempt from disclosure under chapter 92F. The electronic-mail address may be used only for official communication with the voter about the voting process, including transmitting military-overseas ballots and election materials if the voter has requested electronic transmission, and verifying the voter's mailing address and physical location.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="color:black"> (b) A covered voter who provides an electronic-mail address may request that the voter's application for a military-overseas ballot be considered a standing request for electronic delivery of a ballot for all elections held through December 31 of the calendar year of the date of the application or another shorter period the voter specifies, including for any runoff elections that occur as a result of those elections. An election official shall provide a military-overseas ballot to a voter who makes a standing request for each election to which the request is applicable. A covered voter who is entitled to receive a military-overseas ballot for a primary election under this subsection is entitled to receive a military-overseas ballot for the general election.
