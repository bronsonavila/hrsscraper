<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §708-828</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section recognizes that the use value of a person's property may be impaired by the use of noxious substances without the involvement of tampering (§§708-826 to 827) or actual damage (§§708-820 to 823). This form of interference with the use of property can be significantly grave to warrant the low grade of criminal sanction provided by this section.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under previous Hawaii law, the conduct described in this section would fall within the ambit of the indiscriminately-defined offense of common nuisance.[1] The Code sharpens the focus and definition of the offense, as it relates to noxious substances, and reduces slightly the possible penalty.</p>
