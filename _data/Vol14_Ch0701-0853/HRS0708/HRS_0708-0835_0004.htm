<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 59, Session Laws 2005, created the misdemeanor offense of unauthorized operation of a recording device in a motion picture theater. An exception is made for legitimate uses of audiovisual recording devices for a lawfully authorized investigative, protective, law enforcement, or intelligence-gathering employee or agent of the local, state, or federal government. The legislature found that movie piracy through unauthorized audiovisual recordings made in movie theaters has resulted in losses to the motion picture industry, including actors, producers, and distributors of motion pictures. Illicitly copied movies are illegally duplicated, packaged, and distributed across the country and abroad, further aggravating industry losses.
