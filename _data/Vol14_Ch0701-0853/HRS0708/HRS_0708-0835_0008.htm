<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 53, Session Laws 2008, added this section, establishing the misdemeanor offense of theft of a beer keg. Metal beer kegs were being stolen at escalating rates, largely because they can be redeemed for fast cash at scrap dealerships. House Standing Committee Report Nos. 1113-08 and 1671-08.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 44, Session Laws 2009, made permanent the prohibition against stealing beer kegs and the documentation requirements for scrap metal dealers. The legislature found that the prohibitions, record-keeping requirements, and penalties in the current law had proven effective at deterring the theft of beer kegs and should be made permanent. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1240.</p>
