<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง802E-2</b> <b>Court advisement concerning alien status required prior to the commencement of trial, entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or admission of guilt or sufficient facts.</b> Prior to the commencement of trial, entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or admission of guilt or sufficient facts to any offense punishable as a crime under state law, except offenses designated as infractions under state law, the court shall administer the following advisement on the record to the defendant:</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"> If you are not a citizen of the United States, whether or not you have lawful immigration status, you have the right to receive advice from your attorney about the specific impact that this case will have, if any, on your immigration status. The entry of a guilty or nolo contendere plea, admission of guilt or sufficient facts, or conviction, deferred judgment, or deferred sentence may have the consequences of your immediate detention, deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States. In some cases, detention and deportation from the United States will be required. Your lawyer must investigate and advise you about these issues prior to the commencement of trial, entry of a guilty or nolo contendere [plea], or admission of guilt or sufficient facts to any offense punishable as a crime under state law, other than those offenses designated as infractions. You are not required to disclose your immigration or citizenship status to the court.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Upon request, the court shall allow the defendant additional time to consider the appropriateness of the plea in light of the advisement as described in this section. [L 1988, c 382, pt of ยง1; am L 2013; c 279, ยง2]</p>
