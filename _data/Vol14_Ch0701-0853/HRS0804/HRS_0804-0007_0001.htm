<p class="XNotes"> Where restrictions imposed by the trial court were a condition of defendant's bail, defendant's argument that prohibition was overbroad, vague, ambiguous and therefore unconstitutional, was unpersuasive and restrictions imposed were well within the discretion of the trial court. 79 H. 150, 900 P.2d 157 (1995).</p>
