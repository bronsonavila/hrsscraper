<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง806D-2] Production of records. </b>(a) This section shall apply to any criminal process allowing for search of or commanding production of records that are in the actual or constructive possession of a recipient who is properly served outside the State, regardless of whether the recipient or the records are physically located within the State.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) When properly served with criminal process issued under this section, the recipient shall provide the applicant all records sought pursuant to the criminal process. The records shall be produced within twenty business days of service of the criminal process, unless the process requires earlier production. An applicant may consent to a recipient's request for additional time to comply with the criminal process.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Criminal process issued under this section shall contain the following language in bold type on the first page of the document:</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="margin-left:.5in"> "This [warrant, subpoena, order] is issued pursuant to ยง806D-2, Hawaii Revised Statutes. Production is due within twenty business days of service, unless a shorter time is stated herein, or the applicant consents to a recipient's request for additional time to comply."</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) If the issuing court finds reason to suspect that failure to produce records within twenty business days would cause an adverse result, the criminal process may require production of records within less than twenty business days. The court may reasonably extend the time required for production of the records upon finding that the recipient has shown good cause for requesting that extension and that an extension of time would not cause an adverse result.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) When properly served with criminal process issued under this section, a recipient who seeks to quash the criminal process may seek relief from the issuing court only within the time originally required for production of records. The issuing court shall hear and decide the motion no later than five court days after the motion is filed. An applicant's consent, under subsection (b), to a recipient's request for additional time to comply with the criminal process shall not extend the date by which a recipient who seeks relief may do so.
