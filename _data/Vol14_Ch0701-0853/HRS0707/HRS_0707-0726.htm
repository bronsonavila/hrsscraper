<p class="aPenalBlock"> (c) The person, in the absence of a court order determining custody or visitation rights, intentionally or knowingly takes, detains, conceals, or entices away a minor with the intent to deprive another person or a public agency of their right to custody, and removes the minor from the State.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (2) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that the person had "good cause" for the violation of a court order issued pursuant to chapter 586, for the taking, detaining, concealing, or enticing away of the minor, or for removing the minor from the State; provided that the person asserting the affirmative defense filed a report with the clerk of the family court detailing the whereabouts of the minor, the person who took, enticed, detained, concealed, or removed the minor or child, and the circumstances of the event as soon as the filing of the report was practicable; and provided further that the person asserting the affirmative defense also filed a request for a custody order as soon as the filing of the request was practicable.</p>
