<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §§707-752 AND 707-753</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 16, Session Laws 2016, amended §707-752 by amending the definition of the term "sexual conduct" as that term is used in the Penal Code for the offense of promoting child abuse in the third degree. The amendments made by Act 16 aligned the term, as used in state law, more closely with the terminology used in federal law by expanding the definition of "sexual conduct" to include specific types of conduct. Act 16 also removed unnecessary and archaic language regarding sexual orientation. House Standing Committee Report No. 1124-16.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Based on all of the relevant circumstances--that TSA screeners saw photographs of nude and semi-nude children, at least one, if not two photos they saw contained child pornography, and there were additional photos that they were aware of--HCPD officers had an objectively reasonable belief that defendant had committed a violation of this section; in effect, probable cause to arrest defendant existed. 835 F. Supp. 2d 938 (2011).</p>
