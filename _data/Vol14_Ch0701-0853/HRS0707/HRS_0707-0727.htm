<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's assistance to ward of State who had run away from foster home was de minimis infraction under section 702-236. 73 H. 75, 828 P.2d 269 (1992).</p>

<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §§707-726 AND 707-727</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 171, Session Laws 1981, repealed §707-723, relating to custodial interference, a misdemeanor, and enacted §§707-726 and 707-727 to recognize two degrees of custodial interference--in the first degree and in the second degree--and to make first degree custodial interference a felony. A primary reason for creating the felony offense was to enable the State to utilize its power of extradition and to seek federal assistance under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-611). Senate Standing Committee Report No. 792, House Standing Committee Report No. 613. Section 707-727 retains most of the language of repealed §707-723 and reclassifies the offense as custodial interference in the second degree.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 48, Session Laws 1982, amended §707-726 by making the violation of an ex parte temporary restraining order, formerly treated as a misdemeanor, a class C felony. This amendment will provide for punishment commensurate with the violation and allow for the utilization of interstate and federal law enforcement agencies to assist in the return of the absent person.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 314, Session Laws 1986, amended §707-726 by creating a new class C felony for any person who knowingly takes or entices another person less than eleven years old from that person's lawful custodian, if that taking was with the knowledge that the actor had no right to do so. Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 245, Session Laws 1994, amended §707-726 to make it an offense to intentionally or knowingly violate a court order or take, entice, conceal, or detain a minor or child. Act 245 amended §707-727 to make it an offense to intentionally or knowingly take, entice, conceal, or detain a minor or incompetent person, and created a class C felony for custodial interference in the second degree if the minor or incompetent person is taken, enticed, concealed, or detained outside of the State. The amendments to the sections were made to include penalties and language necessary to trigger the assistance of federal authorities. Conference Committee Report No. 26.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 146, Session Laws 1996, amended §707-726 by broadening the offense of custodial interference in the first degree to include the abduction and removal of a child from the State by any person in violation of a court order or before a court order is issued. Under current law, if there is no court order determining custody, a parent who interferes with another parent's right to custody does not commit custodial interference. When a parent takes a child out-of-state, law enforcement is unable to commence an investigation until after a court order determining the child's custody has been made. Current law thus delays the search for the child taken out-of-state. Act 146 also expanded the definition of the person acting. The legislature found that parents and relatives who want to gain physical custody of a child through self-help will seek the assistance of any willing person. The Act also defined "good cause" and made "good cause" an affirmative defense to a prosecution for custodial interference in the first degree. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2029, House Standing Committee Report No. 1239-96, Conference Committee Report No. 74.</p>
