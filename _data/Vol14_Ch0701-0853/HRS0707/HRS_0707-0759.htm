<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 80, Session Laws 2008, added this section, establishing a new offense to address a specific form of grooming conduct by child predators involving masturbation or the lewd or lascivious exposure of the predator's genitals over the computer for view by a minor. The legislature found that with the widespread use and acceptance of the Internet and computers as tools for social networking and the anonymity they appeared to provide, children and teens are at a greater risk for victimization by persons who seek out minors for sexual purposes. Online predators abuse modern day technology to covertly invade what is considered to be the most secure of places, the home.
