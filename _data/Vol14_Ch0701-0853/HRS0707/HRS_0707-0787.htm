<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §§707-780 TO 707-787</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 146, Session Laws 2011, established, among other things, a class A and class B felony offense for labor trafficking, an offense for nonpayment of wages, and an offense for unlawful conduct with respect to documents. The legislature found that Hawaii is one of only five states without a specific labor trafficking statute, yet labor trafficking has occurred at an unprecedented level in the State. Act 146 sent an unmistakable warning to individuals and entities engaged in labor trafficking and provided a clearer and more structured means for law enforcement agencies to protect and aid trafficking victims. Also, Act 146 would be a catalyst for law enforcement agencies, service providers, and other state agencies and community organizations to engage in needed training and education on labor trafficking. Conference Committee Report No. 77.</p>
