<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §§707-730 TO 707-734</p>
<p class="XNotesHeading"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 153, Session Laws 2016, amended §707-731 to include within the offense of sexual assault in the second degree a person who knowingly subjects to sexual penetration a minor at least sixteen years of age if the person is contemporaneously acting in a professional capacity to instruct, advise, or supervise the minor, with certain exceptions. The legislature found that sexual relations between a person who is younger than sixteen years, the age of consent, and a person who is not less than five years older was a crime even if the younger person consents. However, once a minor attains sixteen years of age, consensual sexual activity was not a crime and the minor was not protected from adults who abuse the power of their position to obtain consent. House Standing Committee Report No. 280-16, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3309.</p>
