<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> The Code follows the lead of the Model Penal Code in providing two general sections for conduct which recklessly endangers human life.[1] Previous Hawaii law covered, as does the law of most jurisdictions,[2] such cases of reckless endangering on an ad hoc basis.[3] A quick perusal of such statutes reveals that they all have in common the reckless endangering of human life. The Code obviates the need for special legislation on each dangerous instrument or act. Rather, all conduct so endangering human life or limb is made a misdemeanor.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The aggravated offense of reckless endangering in the first degree, §707-713, is reserved for cases where the actor employs "widely dangerous means." Widely dangerous means, as defined in §708-800, are those means which are known to be capable of causing widespread damage or destruction to both life and property. It is thought that where the potential for destruction is this great, the actor's dangerousness to society is increased so substantially, over the case where only a single or a few people are threatened, that the felony sanction is justified.</p>
