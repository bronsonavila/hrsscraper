<p class="XNotes"> Act 314, Session Laws 1986, provided for enhanced sentences for an adult offering to pay a juvenile to commit a crime. This offense is aimed at deterring adults from inducing juveniles to engage in criminal activity, a practice frequently used because juveniles are generally given lesser sentences than those for adults for the same crime.
