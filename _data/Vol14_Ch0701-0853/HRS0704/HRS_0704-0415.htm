<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §704-415</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Following the filing of the report pursuant to §704-414, the court may grant the application summarily if it is convinced that it can be granted without danger to the defendant or to the person or property of others. The Code allows the court some flexibility in taking testimony of examiners without the necessity of a full hearing. If the testimony of the examiners, in addition to the report, satisfies the court that favorable action on the application is appropriate, it may be granted summarily. If the court is not satisfied, a full hearing is indicated, following which the court shall make a determination consistent with the danger the committed or conditionally released person presents to oneself and to others.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The Code takes the position that the burden should remain with the State to prove that the freedom applied for cannot be safely granted.</p>
