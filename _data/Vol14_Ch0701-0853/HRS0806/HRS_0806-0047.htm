<p class="XNotes"> Where, in accordance with this section, the family court considered the whole record of the case and the entire course of the proceedings against defendant and found that a bill of particulars was unnecessary because defendant was not actually misled or prejudiced as to the charges against defendant, and the court denied defendant's motion to dismiss or for bill of particulars on that basis, the court did not abuse its discretion. 121 H. 451, 220 P.3d 1032 (2009).</p>
