It is no defense to indictment that facts in proof show that defendant committed offense of higher degree than charged. 22 H. 773 (1915), 779. Issuance and service of warrant may be waived and jurisdiction conferred by general appearance and plea to charge. 23 H. 250 (1916). Motion to quash is addressed to discretion of court and is usually based upon matters of record. Special plea in bar presents some matter extrinsic of record which completely bars proceeding and to which court may exercise no discretion and is bound to sustain plea if well taken. 25 H. 55 (1919), 57.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> An indictment should contain such specification of acts and descriptive circumstances as will on its face fix and determine identity of offense with such particularity as to enable accused to know exactly what accused has to meet. 25 H. 381 (1920), 383. Sufficiency of indictment. 25 H. 747 (1921), 760; 33 H. 560 superseded by stat. as stated in 36 H. 355 (1943). The fact that one crime is charged more than once in synonymous expressions is not fatal to indictment. 12 H. 159 (1899); 25 H. 814 (1921). Indictment, although laid in language of statute, may fall short of specifying acts and descriptive circumstances so as to apprise defendant what defendant has to meet. 24 H. 565 (1918); 25 H. 429 (1920), 437; 25 H. 584 (1920).
