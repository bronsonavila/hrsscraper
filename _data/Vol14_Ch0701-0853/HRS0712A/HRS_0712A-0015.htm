<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[§712A-15] Disposition of claims by court.</b> (1) Following the court's disposition of all claims filed under this chapter, or if no such claims are filed, following the expiration of the period provided in this chapter for the filing of such claims, the State has clear title to property that is the subject of the in rem or in personam petition and the court shall so order. Title to the forfeited property and its proceeds is deemed to have vested in the State on the commission of the act or omission giving rise to the forfeiture.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (2) The court, on motion of the prosecuting attorney, may release or convey forfeited personal property to an interest- holder who has satisfied both the prosecuting attorney and the court that all of the following are true:</p>
<p class="aPenalBlock"> (a) The interest-holder has an interest which was acquired in the regular course of business as a financial institution and which is not subject to forfeiture pursuant to section 712A-5;</p>
<p class="aPenalBlock"> (b) The amount of the interest-holder's encumbrance and the fair market value of the property are readily determinable and both amounts have been reasonably established by proof made available by the attorney for the State to the court;</p>
<p class="aPenalBlock"> (c) There are no encumbrances on the property other than encumbrances held by the interest-holder seeking possession; and</p>
<p class="aPenalBlock"> (d) The interest-holder has satisfied the State's interest by tendering the fair market value of the property and the expenses of its sale or disposal by the interest- holder.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (3) Upon order of the court forfeiting the subject property the attorney general may transfer good and sufficient title to any subsequent purchaser or transferee, and the title shall be recognized by all courts, by this State, and by all departments and agencies of this State and any political subdivision thereof.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (4) Upon entry of judgment for a claimant or claimants in any proceeding to forfeit property under this chapter such property or interest in property shall be returned or conveyed to the claimant or claimants designated by the court. If it appears that there was reasonable cause for the seizure for forfeiture or the filing of the complaint, the court shall cause a finding to be entered, and the claimant is not, in such case, entitled to costs or damages. Nor, in such case, is the person or seizing agency, or its agents, who made the seizure, or the prosecuting attorney or the attorney general liable to suit or judgment on account of such seizure, suit, or prosecution.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (5) The court shall order any claimant who fails to establish that the claimant's entire interest is exempt from forfeiture under section 712A-5 to pay the costs of any claimant who establishes that the entire interest is exempt from forfeiture under section 712A-5, and the State's costs and expenses of the investigation and prosecution of the matter, including reasonable attorney fees.
