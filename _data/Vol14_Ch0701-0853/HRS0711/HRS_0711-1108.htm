<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section prohibits any sort of outrageous treatment of a human corpse, including sexual contact (necrophilia) and physical abuse. It does not, of course, relate to legally authorized activities of undertakers and physicians. Knowledge that ordinary family sensibilities would be outraged must be proved.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Previous Hawaii law prohibited the disinterment, disturbance, or scattering of any human body that has been legally interred.[1] Section 711-1108 is more comprehensive in coverage.</p>

<p class="XNotesHeading">SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §711-1108</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 171, Session Laws 2015, amended this section to recognize and support traditional Hawaiian burial or cremation practices by clarifying that the preparation, burial, or cremation of a corpse in a manner consistent with Hawaiian cultural customs and practices is not a violation of the Penal Code's prohibition of abuse of a corpse. The legislature found that Act 171 was necessary to address confusion about whether the use of traditional Hawaiian customs and practices to prepare human remains for burial or cremation and the burial or cremation of a corpse prepared consistent with those customs and practices violate the law.
