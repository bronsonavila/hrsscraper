<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §711-1100</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section is definitional only and, of course, specifies no offense. A discussion of the definitions in this section, when needed or appropriate, is found in the commentary to the substantive offenses employing the terms defined.</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotesHeading">SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §711-1100</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> The Code as adopted added Items (5) and (6). The Proposed Draft did not contain these items.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 192, Session Laws 1986, amended the definition of "animal" to exclude human beings, thereby foreclosing the possible interpretation of the statute to include within the offense persons engaged in boxing. House Conference Committee Report No. 37-86, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 27-86, and House Standing Committee Report No. 392.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 292, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by adding the definition of "facsimile" to strengthen the laws against harassment. Conference Committee Report No. 57.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 173, Session Laws 1998, amended this section by adding the definitions of "pet animal" and "necessary sustenance." Act 173 protected pet animals in Hawaii from neglect by defining minimum standards of care. The legislature found that pet animals deserved at least the minimum care of food, water, and protection from the elements. Act 173 established guidelines to be used to prevent the neglect and abuse of pet animals. Conference Committee Report No. 87.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 48, Session Laws 2003, amended this section by adding the definition of "record." The legislature found that advancement in technology has provided opportunity for "video voyeurism" in public places. A change in the offense of violation of privacy would address the growing concern for the offensive practice of "upskirt photography." House Standing Committee Report No. 1316.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 83, Session Laws 2004, amended the definition of "record" to include digital recordings within the purview of privacy offenses. Act 83 made statutory amendments to the existing privacy law in order to prohibit the inappropriate use of new digital technologies, such as cellular phones, that are capable of taking digital photographs and transmitting those images. House Standing Committee Report No. 1174-04, Conference Committee Report No. 43-04.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 114, Session Laws 2007, amended this section by, among other things, defining "pet animal" as a dog, cat, domesticated rabbit, guinea pig, [domesticated pig,] or caged birds, so long as they are not bred for consumption. Act 114 strengthened Hawaii's animal cruelty laws. The legislature found that violence, whether against humans or animals, must not be tolerated in our society. Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse and the commission of violent acts against humans. Hawaii is only one of nine states in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal abuse. The legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional bond and relationship with their owners and family members and friends. Violence and harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional impact on their owners and family. The felony provisions of Act 114 protected pet animals. Conference Committee Report No. 29.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 111, Session Laws 2008, amended this section by adding the definition of "equine animal." Act 111 extended to equine animals some of the legal protections accorded to pet animals relating to animal cruelty by making an offense involving serious bodily injury or death to an equine animal a class C felony. The legislature believed that horses belong under the protection of law and that adding equine animals to the list of animals protected under the animal cruelty law reflects the fact that companion animals come in all shapes and sizes. House Standing Committee Report No. 1589-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2879, Conference Committee Report No. 20-08.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 147, Session Laws 2010, amended this section by adding the definition of "primary pet enclosure," and by amending the definition of "necessary sustenance" to include the requirements of an area of confinement in a primary pet enclosure and veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering. The legislature found that existing definitions applicable to cruelty to animals lack specificity in the areas regarding a primary pet enclosure and the range of care needed to sufficiently preserve a pet animal's health and well-being. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2957, Conference Committee Report No. 37-10.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 205, Session Laws 2013, amended this section by adding the definition of "law enforcement animal." Act 205 amended §§711-1109.4 and 711-1109.5 to protect law enforcement animals in the line of duty. The legislature found that law enforcement animals are an integral part of Hawaii's law enforcement and corrections agencies and are hand-selected and highly trained for their jobs. The animals diligently work side-by-side with law enforcement officers, deputies, and other personnel and should be afforded special protections. Conference Committee Report No. 128.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 35, Session Laws 2015, amended the definition of "necessary sustenance" by making technical nonsubstantive amendments.</p>
