<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §711-1105</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although obstructing was formerly covered by the disorderly conduct statute, it raises certain important problems which indicate that it should have separate treatment. Primarily the problems relate to free speech and types of expressive conduct which, under the aegis of free speech, are constitutionally protected. Normally, the act of obstructing a public highway presents a great public inconvenience and serves no useful purpose. However, where the obstruction is caused by a crowd listening to a speaker, or even by a crowd protesting some official action, important goals are served by leaving the group as free from restriction as possible. The proposed section accomplishes these objectives.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Subsection (1) defines obstructing as knowing or reckless obstruction of any highway or public passage. "Obstructs" is defined in §711-1100 as "renders impassable without unreasonable inconvenience or hazard." This conduct constitutes a violation, and if the defendant fails to heed a warning by a peace officer, it may be treated as a petty misdemeanor. However, subsection (4) makes clear that a person does not violate subsection (1) solely because of the fact that people gather to hear the person speak, or because the person is a member of such a gathering.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Subsection (2) is intended to allow reasonable control by peace officers of a public gathering which obstructs highways or which is dangerously close to a public hazard, such as a flood. A person who fails to heed a reasonable request by a peace officer in such circumstances is guilty of a violation. However, subsection (3) declares that a person engaged in speech or other lawful behavior which attracts an obstructing crowd cannot be asked to move if the obstruction can be readily remedied by police control.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Previous Hawaii law treated obstruction as a part of disorderly conduct.[1] The prior statute recognized and protected the rights of the speaker, but it seems insufficient in that it did not protect the rights of the listening audience. The Code attempts to remedy this point.</p>
