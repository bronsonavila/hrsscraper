<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Extended sentence imposed on multiple offender held not cruel and unusual punishment. 56 H. 343, 537 P.2d 724 (1975).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Breach of plea agreement by prosecutor resulting from participation in extended term hearing may be remedied by remand for resentencing by another judge. 60 H. 93, 588 P.2d 412 (1978); 60 H. 104, 588 P.2d 408 (1978).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Participation by prosecutor in hearing for extended term sentencing, even though pursuant to order of court, constituted breach of plea agreement. 60 H. 93, 588 P.2d 412 (1978).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No abuse of discretion in court sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment under this section and §706-662 where, inter alia, court considered each of the factors enumerated in §706-606 and all the mitigating factors raised by defendant. 83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258 (1996).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As §706-600 and this section do not authorize a court to impose a single sentence on a defendant who has been convicted of multiple charges, trial court did not violate plea agreement by imposing a life term for each class A felony defendant was convicted of, and then running each life term concurrently. 91 H. 20, 979 P.2d 1046 (1999).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures was not offended by the plain language of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d, amending §§706-662, 706-664, and this section regarding sentencing or resentencing for extended terms of imprisonment, where it was clear that the new jury provisions did not (1) increase criminal liability for conduct previously innocent, (2) aggravate the degree of defendant's crimes, (3) increase the punishment available at the time defendant committed defendant's crimes, or (4) alter evidentiary standards to defendant's detriment. 117 H. 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The constitutional prohibition against ex post facto measures was not offended by the retrospective application to defendant of Act 1, L Sp 2007 2d, amending §§706-662, 706-664, and this section, where Act 1 did not punish as a crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done, make more burdensome the punishment for the crime after its commission, nor deprive one charged with the crime of any defense available according to the law when the act was committed. 118 H. 68 (App.), 185 P.3d 816 (2008).</p>
