<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 119, Session Laws 2014, added this section to impose a human trafficking victim services fee upon individuals who are convicted of certain trafficking offenses and to establish the human trafficking victim services fund, to provide support and services to human trafficking victims. The legislature found that existing law did not provide a source of revenue to support and provide services to human trafficking victims who often require access to basic and life-sustaining services, including toiletries and food, and may require long-term access to stable and supportive environments, such as licensed residential treatment facilities. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3043, Conference Committee Report No. 97-14.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended subsection (5) to implement recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015).</p>
