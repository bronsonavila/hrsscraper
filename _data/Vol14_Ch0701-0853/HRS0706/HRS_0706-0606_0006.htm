<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §706-606.6</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 286, Session Laws 1999, added this section, mandating an extended term of imprisonment for multiple offenses, to heighten penalties for habitual violent and sexual offenders. The legislature found that repeat violent and sexual offenders deserve some degree of enhanced sentencing. Conference Committee Report No. 89.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 60, Session Laws 2006, amended this section by deleting the references to §707-733.5, repealed by Act 60, and substituting references to §707-733.6, added by Act 60. Act 60 reenacted provisions that define the behavior that constitutes the crime of continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years and the unanimity that is required to convict a person of the crime. House Standing Committee Report No. 150-06.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 114, Session Laws 2014, amended this section to include the offenses of promoting prostitution in the first and second degrees, and solicitation of a minor for prostitution. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3249, Conference Committee Report No. 41-14.</p>
