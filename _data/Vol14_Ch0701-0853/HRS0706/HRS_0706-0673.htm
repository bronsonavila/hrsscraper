<p class="XNotes"> Act 193, Session Laws 1990, added this section which would require the department of public safety to notify victims or their next-of-kin of an escape by the prisoner who committed a crime against the victim. The legislature felt this requirement would make victims of crimes feel more secure knowing they would be notified immediately if the prisoner escaped. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2935.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 383, Session Laws 1997, amended this section by amending the definition of "surviving immediate family member" to include a reciprocal beneficiary. The amendment establishes the status of reciprocal beneficiaries and provides certain state governmental benefits to those with that status. Among the benefits extended to reciprocal beneficiaries which are substantially equivalent to those extended to spouses is legal standing relating to victims rights. Conference Committee Report No. 2.</p>
