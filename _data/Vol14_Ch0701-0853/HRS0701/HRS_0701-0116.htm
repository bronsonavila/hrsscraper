<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> The draft follows the Model Penal Code in defining a standard of proof of facts called for in application of the Code. It would cover, for example, a finding that the defendant lacks mental capacity to proceed.[1] It logically places the burden of proof on the side whose interest or contention would be furthered if the finding is made. Proof must be by a preponderance of the evidence. Thus when facts making the defendant subject to increased penalties must be proved,[2] the prosecution need not prove them beyond a reasonable doubt, but only by preponderant evidence. The Model Penal Code draftsmen explain:</p>
<p class="XNotes" style="margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:-27.0pt"> ... proof that satisfies the court is not likely to leave room for a substantial doubt; and this, in our view, affords an adequate protection in an area where we deliberately have sought to broaden the discretion of the court.[3]</p>
