<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Will appear in court at the time designated;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Under oath administered by any police officer whose name has been submitted to the prosecuting officer and who has been designated by the chief of police to administer the oath; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) By declaration in accordance with the rules of court.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) If a person fails to appear in answer to the citation; or if there is reasonable cause to believe that the person will not appear, a warrant for the person's arrest may be issued. A knowing failure to appear in answer to the citation may be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than thirty days or both.
