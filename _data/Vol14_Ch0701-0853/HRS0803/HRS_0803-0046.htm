The thirty-day period begins on the earlier of the day on which the investigative or law enforcement officer first begins to conduct an interception under the order or ten days after the order is entered. Extensions of an order may be granted, but only upon application for an extension made in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section and the court making the findings required by subsection (c) of this section.

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) The subject matter of the conversation;</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) Whenever an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to this part, the order shall require reports to be made to the designated judge who issued the order showing what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception. The reports shall be made at such intervals as the designated judge may require.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (g)(1) The contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted by any means authorized by this part, if possible, shall be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device. The recording of the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication under this subsection shall be done to protect the recording from being edited or otherwise altered. Immediately upon the expiration of the time period provided in the order, or extensions thereof, the recording shall be made available to the designated judge issuing the order and sealed under the designated judge's directions. Custody of the recording shall be determined by order of the designated judge. Recordings and other evidence of the contents of conversations and applications and orders shall not be destroyed except upon an order of the designated judge and in any event shall be kept for ten years.

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Applications made and orders granted under this part and evidence obtained through court-ordered interceptions shall be sealed by the designated judge.

The inventory shall include notice of:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The fact of the entry of the order;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) The date of the entry and the period of authorized, or approved interception; and</p>

The designated judge may order the additional disclosure as the designated judge determines to be in the interest of justice. On an ex parte showing of good cause, the designated judge may permit the serving of the inventory required by this subsection to be postponed.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (h) The contents of any intercepted wire, oral, or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom shall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in any court of this State unless each party, not less than thirty days before the trial, hearing or proceeding, has been furnished with copies of the documents required to be disclosed, and contents of intercepted communications or other evidence obtained as a result of interception which is sought to be admitted in evidence. This thirty-day period may be shortened or waived by the court if it finds that the party will not be prejudiced by the delay in receiving such information.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (i)(1) Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of this State, or a political subdivision thereof, may move to suppress the content of any intercepted wire, oral, or electronic communication, or evidence derived therefrom, on the grounds that:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The communication was unlawfully intercepted;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) The order of authorization or approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) The interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> Such motion shall be made before the trial, hearing, or proceedings unless there was no opportunity to make such motion or the person was not aware of the grounds of the motion.

The court, or other official before whom the motion is made, upon the filing of the motion by the aggrieved person, may make available to the aggrieved person or the aggrieved person's counsel for inspection portions of the recording that contain intercepted communications of the defendant or evidence derived therefrom, the applications, orders, transcript of testimony, and such additional evidence as the court determines to be in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) In addition to any other right to appeal the State shall have the right to appeal:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) From an order granting a motion to suppress made under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the attorney general or prosecuting attorney of a county, or their designated representatives, shall certify to the designated judge or other official granting the motion that the appeal shall be taken within thirty days after the date the order of suppression was entered and shall be diligently prosecuted as in the case of other interlocutory appeals or under such rules as the supreme court may adopt;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) From an order denying an application for an order of authorization or approval, and such an appeal shall be in camera and in preference to all other pending appeals in accordance with rules promulgated by the supreme court.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (j) The requirements of subsections (a)(2)(B) and (c)(4) relating to the specification of the facilities from which, or the place where, the communication is to be intercepted do not apply if:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) In the case of an application with respect to the interception of an oral communication:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The application is by an investigative or law enforcement officer and is approved by the attorney general, a county prosecuting attorney, or one of their designees;</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) The designated judge finds that the specification is not practical; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) In the case of an application with respect to a wire or electronic communication:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The application is by an investigative or law enforcement officer and is approved by the attorney general, a prosecuting attorney, or one of their designees;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) The application identifies the person believed to be committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted and the applicant makes a showing of a purpose on the part of that person to thwart interception by changing facilities; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) The designated judge finds that the purpose has been adequately shown.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">An interception of a communication under an order with respect to which the requirements of subsections (a)(2)(B) and (c)(4) do not apply by reason of subsection (j) shall not begin until the facilities from which, or the place where the communication is to be intercepted, is ascertained by the person implementing the interception order. A provider of wire or electronic communications service that has received an order as provided for in subsection (d) may move the court to modify or quash the order on the ground that its assistance with respect to the interception cannot be performed in a timely or reasonable manner. The court, upon notice to the State, shall decide the motion expeditiously.
