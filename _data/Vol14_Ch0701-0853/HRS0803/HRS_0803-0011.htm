But before breaking any door, the officer or person shall first demand entrance in a loud voice, and state that the officer or person is the bearer of a warrant of arrest; or if it is in a case in which arrest is lawful without warrant, the officer or person shall substantially state that information in an audible voice.

<p class="XNotes"> Where the police opened a closed screen door and broke the threshold of defendant's dwelling prior to announcing that they bore an arrest warrant and failed to wait a reasonable time after demanding entry, this section was violated; thus, subsequent search of defendant's home and seizure of evidence therefrom were inadmissible. 108 H. 436, 121 P.3d 901 (2005).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where officers failed to state they were bearers of an arrest warrant before "breaking" the screen door and failed to wait a "reasonable time" after demanding entrance before "breaking" the door and crossing the threshold, the officers did not satisfy the "knock and announce" rule nor did they comply with the requirements of this section and the trial court's conclusions of law to the contrary were erroneous. 108 H. 446 (App.), 121 P.3d 911 (2005).</p>
