The order may authorize the use of that device within the jurisdiction of the court and outside that jurisdiction, if the device is installed in that jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) If, upon application to the designated judge for a court order, the designated judge should satisfy itself that there are sufficient facts and circumstances contained within the application to establish probable cause to believe that the use of a mobile tracking device will discover the fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of a crime or is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If the designated judge is so satisfied, it shall issue an order specifying:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The identity, if known, of the person who is the subject of the investigation;</p>
