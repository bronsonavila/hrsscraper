<p class="XNotesHeading">SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §§712-1241 TO 712-1250</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 231, Session Laws 2016, amended §§712-1241(1) and 712-1242(1) by placing possession and distribution of methamphetamine in the sections, giving the court the discretion to impose probation and drug treatment when appropriate. Act 231 removed possession and distribution of methamphetamine from the methamphetamine trafficking statutes [by amending §§712-1240.7 and 712-1240.9 and repealing §712-1240.8]. The amendments implemented recommendations made by the Penal Code Review Committee convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, S.D. 1 (2015). The Penal Code Review Committee commented, on page 59 of its report, that "[w]hile the Committee recognizes these dangers and challenges, it is of the opinion that the current Methamphetamine Trafficking statutes are not properly addressing those challenges and should be changed based on the experience of the Committee regarding the application of these provisions in the criminal justice system in Hawaii." House Standing Committee Report No. 660-16.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Under the circumstances of the case, the free exercise clause of the First Amendment was not a viable defense to prosecution under this section; this section is a neutral law of general applicability to the extent it purports to prohibit, without exception, the possession of marijuana and any other substance defined as a "Schedule V substance" by chapter 329, it does not interfere with other constitutional rights, and it does not create a mechanism for governmental assessment of individual applicants for exemptions. 115 H. 396, 168 P.3d 526.
