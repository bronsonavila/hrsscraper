<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b> </b>Act 216, Session Laws 2012, added this section to: (1) authorize a person convicted of committing the offense of prostitution to file a motion to vacate the conviction under certain circumstances; and (2) establish procedures for the motion to vacate the conviction. The legislature found that human trafficking, consisting of the subjugation, recruitment, harboring, or transportation of people for the purpose of forced labor or services, or commercial sexual exploitation, was one of the fastest growing criminal industries. Act 216 would assist in combating human trafficking by allowing trafficking victims who were forced into prostitution to file a motion to have their prostitution convictions vacated from their records. Conference Committee Report No. 109-12.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 35, Session Laws 2015, amended subsection (1)(b) by changing: (1) the phrase "severe form of trafficking" to "severe form of trafficking in persons"; and (2) "title 22 United States Code section 7102(13)" to "title 22 United States Code section 7102(9)(A)."</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 206, Session Laws 2016, amended this section to conform to amendments made to other sections in the Hawaii Revised Statutes by Act 206. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3450.</p>
