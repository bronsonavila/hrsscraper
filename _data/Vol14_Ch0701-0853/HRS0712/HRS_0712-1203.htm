<p class="XNotes"> Act 206, Session Laws 2016, amended §712-1201 by amending the section heading to conform to amendments made to other sections in the Hawaii Revised Statutes by Act 206.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 206, Session Laws 2016, amended §712-1202, among others, to establish a victim and survivor-centered approach to comprehensive anti-sex trafficking laws. Specifically, Act 206 amended §712-1202 by: (1) replacing the offense of promoting prostitution in the first degree with sex trafficking, a class A felony and violent crime; and (2) specifying that the offense of sex trafficking requires proof of negligence with respect to the victim's age when the victim of sex trafficking is under eighteen years of age. The legislature found that the existing laws relating to prostitution and promoting prostitution may not have been suitable to address certain circumstances in which coercion or other inability to consent is present. Act 206 allowed Hawaii to join other states that had adopted comprehensive anti-sex trafficking legislation. Conference Committee Report No. 147-16, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3450.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 206, Session Laws 2016, amended §712-1203 to change the offense of promoting prostitution in the second degree to the offense of promoting prostitution. Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3450.</p>
