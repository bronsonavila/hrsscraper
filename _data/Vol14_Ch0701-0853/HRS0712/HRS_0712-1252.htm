<p class="XNotes"> Much of the difficulty in proving possession of a dangerous drug, harmful drug or detrimental drug when the substance is found in a motor vehicle is also present in proving mens rea with respect to (1) the character, nature, or quantity of the substance possessed, dispensed, or sold, and (2) the transferee's status as a minor. In cases involving offenses defined in this part, direct evidence, on these issues, such as self- incriminating statements, are rare. Section 712-1252 provides an evidentiary rule analogous to that found in §712-1216 (relating to obscenity offenses). It permits the prosecution to get its case before the trier of fact on issues where direct evidence is difficult to obtain, but it does not change the prosecution's burden of proof.</p>
