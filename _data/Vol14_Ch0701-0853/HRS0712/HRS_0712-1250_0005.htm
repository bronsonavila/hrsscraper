<p class="XNotes"> Act 122, Session Laws 1984, added the new offense of promoting intoxicating liquor to a minor which prohibits persons from giving liquor to a minor, or allowing a minor to possess intoxicating liquor on property under that person's control. The legislature believed that the passage of this Act would reduce the number of drunk drivers and deaths resulting from drunk driving. Senate Conference Report No. 40.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 207, Session Laws 1992, removed the repeal date of Act 342, Session Laws of Hawaii 1986, to permanently raise the minimum drinking age to twenty-one. Conference Committee Report No. 9.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 203, Session Laws 2006, clarified that individuals who promote liquor to minors are persons who knowingly sell, offer for sale, influence the sale, serve, deliver, or give intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of twenty-one. House Standing Committee Report No. 1127-06.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 54, Session Laws 2013, amended this section to curtail underage drinking by requiring a reckless rather than a knowing state of mind for the misdemeanor crime of promoting intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of twenty-one. The legislature believed that this Act would help increase compliance with the law by necessitating identification checks, at minimum, for those that hold liquor licenses, as well as hold accountable those persons who allow or influence the sale, possession, or consumption of alcohol to a person under the age of twenty-one.
