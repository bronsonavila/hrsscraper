<p class="XNotes"> As California statute did not authorize defendant to possess or cultivate fifty or more marijuana plants in violation of this section, trial court did not err in concluding that §712-1240.1 was inapplicable to the case and the documents submitted in support of defendant's motion to dismiss were not clearly exculpatory; thus, trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss. 108 H. 169, 118 P.3d 652 (2005).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court did not err in concluding that defendant failed to prove that this section unconstitutionally burdened the free exercise of defendants religion where defendant failed to establish that the trial court clearly erred in finding that defendant did not demonstrate that defendant's religion required possession or cultivation of fifty or more marijuana plants. 108 H. 169, 118 P.3d 652 (2005).</p>
