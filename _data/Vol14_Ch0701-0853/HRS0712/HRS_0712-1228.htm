<p class="XNotes"> Offenses of possession of gambling records and gambling devices pose a special problem regarding proof of the requisite knowledge of the contents and character of the records or the device. In cases which require proof of the occurrence of sporting events, strict adherence to the rules of evidence would force the prosecution in its case in chief to incur great expense on an issue which may not realistically be in controversy. Therefore, this section provides two evidentiary rules designed to let the prosecutor get the case to the jury in situations where direct evidence is difficult or expensive to obtain and the weight of the logical inference in each situation is sufficient to warrant the special rule.</p>
