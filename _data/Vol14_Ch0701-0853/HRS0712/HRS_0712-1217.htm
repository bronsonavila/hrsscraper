<p class="XNotes"> This section penalizes open lewdness which does not amount to a sexual offense under chapter 707 of this Code, but which "amounts to gross flouting of community standards in respect to sexuality or nudity in public."[1] The section does not apply to cult nudism because of the requirement that the act take place when it is known by the actor that the actor's conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm.</p>
