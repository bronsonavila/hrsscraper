<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §712-1209.1</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 247, Session Laws 2013, added this section, establishing the offense of solicitation of a minor for prostitution as a class C felony for offenders eighteen years of age or older. Act 247 also established a mandatory fine for a person convicted of the offense of solicitation of a minor for prostitution. The legislature found that Act 247 strengthened the laws and penalties for crimes that exploit children subjected to prostitution. Conference Committee Report No. 64.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 114, Session Laws 2014, amended this section by: (1) clarifying that the offense of solicitation of a minor for prostitution applies to intentional, knowing, or reckless conduct; (2) specifying that the offense applies to solicitation of a person who represents that person's self as a minor only if that person is a member of a police department, a sheriff, or a law enforcement officer; (3) increasing the minimum fine imposed on a person convicted of the offense; (4) providing an exemption for law enforcement acting in the course and scope of duties; and (5) making the offense of solicitation of a minor for prostitution a strict liability offense in regards to age. The legislature unequivocally intended the solicitation of a minor for prostitution to be a strict liability offense with regard to the age of the minor. Any specified state of mind listed therein does not apply to the age of a victim solicited under this section. Therefore, a defendant charged under this section may not defend as to the defendant's state of mind concerning the age of the victim, and will be strictly liable with respect to the age of the victim and the attendant circumstance of the victim's age. Conference Committee Report No. 41-14, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3249.</p>
