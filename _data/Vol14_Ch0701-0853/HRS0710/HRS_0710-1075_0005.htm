<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 156, Session Laws 1981, enacted this section to provide additional protection to jurors. Although the prior law penalized force or threats used against a juror before or during a trial, it contained no provision dealing specifically with the offense of force or threats directed against a person for the person's actions as a juror, after the trial.</p>
