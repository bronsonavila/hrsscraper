<p class="XNotes"> Act 223, Session Laws 1991, added this section which provides a penalty for destroying or defacing official notices. The legislature felt that a protected notice should contain a statement that the destruction, removal or defacement of an official notice is prohibited by law, in order to make it clear to the public the importance of the document. Conference Committee Report No. 46.</p>
