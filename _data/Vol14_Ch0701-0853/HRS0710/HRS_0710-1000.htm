<p class="XNotesHeading">COMMENTARY ON §710-1000</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section is definitional only and, of course, specifies no offense. A discussion of the definitions in this section, when needed or appropriate, is found in the commentary to the substantive offenses employing the terms defined.</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotesHeading">SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON §710-1000</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 33, Session Laws 2014, amended this section by adding the following definitions: "electronic," "falsely alter," "falsely complete," "falsely make," "information," and "record." Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3330, House Standing Committee Report No. 260-14.</p>

<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs failed to establish that defendant received pecuniary benefit from five million dollar gift to city and county  of Honolulu. 906 F. Supp. 1377 (1995).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> "Custody" construed. 59 H. 456, 583 P.2d 337 (1978).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree does not require a nexus between the alleged threat and the threatened person's status as a public servant where the threatened person is a government officer or employee; thus, trial court did not err in failing to give a nexus instruction. 111 H. 327, 141 P.3d 974 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under paragraph (15), any "officer or employee of any branch of government" qualifies as a public servant. 105 H. 261 (App.), 96 P.3d 590 (2004).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under paragraph (15), a person qualifies as a public servant based on the type of work he or she performs, and not based on when that work is being performed. 105 H. 261 (App.), 96 P.3d 590 (2004).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> There was no support for the government's argument that paragraph (3) [defining "custody"] sets forth "elements" that the prosecution must prove in order to sustain a conviction under §710-1021; none of the modes of custody set forth in paragraph (3) is an element of the crime of escape from custody. 782 F.3d 510 (2015).</p>
