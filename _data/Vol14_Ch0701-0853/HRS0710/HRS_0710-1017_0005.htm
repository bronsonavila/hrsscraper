<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Act 230, Session Laws 2001, created the criminal offense of the sale or manufacture of deceptive identification documents. Testimony regarding the measure indicated that identification documents, such as driver licenses, identification cards, and birth certificates, have become prey to unscrupulous commercial enterprises that have created a market for selling falsified official identification documents. False identification documents could be used in place of authentic documents for everyday purposes, such as proof of identification, age, or citizenship.
