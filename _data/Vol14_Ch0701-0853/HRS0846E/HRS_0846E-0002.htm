<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> As the registration requirements of chapter 846E do not interfere with any of a sex offender's protected liberty interests, the protections of procedural due process are not triggered. 97 H. 285, 36 P.3d 1255 (2001).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The lifetime registration component of the Hawaii sex offender registration statute implicates a protected liberty interest under the Hawaii constitution, article I, §5 and requires that minimum requirements of due process--notice and opportunity to be heard--be afforded to convicted sex offenders; such a proceeding may be instituted by a sex offender in a special proceeding. 105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).</p>
