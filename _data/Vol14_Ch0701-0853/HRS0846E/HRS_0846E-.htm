<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Indecent exposure, in violation of §707-734, does not constitute an offense that entails "criminal sexual conduct" and, consequently, persons convicted of indecent exposure are not "sex offenders" for purposes of this chapter; thus, defendant was not required to register as a "sex offender" pursuant to this chapter. 102 H. 383, 76 P.3d 935 (2003).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Registration requirements under this chapter not cruel and unusual punishment under article I, §12 of the Hawaii constitution as registration requirements are not so punitive in nature as to overcome legislature's remedial purpose. 105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The lifetime registration component of the Hawaii sex offender registration statute implicates a protected liberty interest under the Hawaii constitution, article I, §5 and requires that minimum requirements of due process--notice and opportunity to be heard--be afforded to convicted sex offenders; such a proceeding may be instituted by a sex offender in a special proceeding. 105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> This chapter, as applied to defendant, was not grossly disproportionate to the offenses for which defendant was convicted, as proportionality is not guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment; the question was whether the statute itself effects a punishment which was both severe and unknown to Anglo-American tradition. 105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> This chapter not violative of ex post facto clause under Article I, §10 of the U.S. Constitution as legislature's express purpose was for chapter to be remedial rather than punitive and statutory scheme is not so punitive as to negate the State's remedial purpose. 105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (2004).</p>
