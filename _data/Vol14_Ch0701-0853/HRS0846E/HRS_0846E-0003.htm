<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="margin-left:.5in">"Information regarding covered offenders is permitted pursuant to chapter 846E. Public access to this information is based solely on the fact of each offender's criminal conviction and is not based on an estimate of the offender's level of dangerousness. By allowing public access to this information, the State makes no representation as to whether the covered offenders listed are dangerous. Any person who uses the information in this registry to injure, harass, or commit a criminal act against any person included in the registry may be subject to criminal prosecution, civil liability, or both."</p>

<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> As this section operated to deprive defendant of a protected liberty interest and provided defendant with neither notice nor an opportunity to be heard prior to notifying the public of defendant's status as a convicted sex offender, this section denied defendant due process under article I, §5 of the Hawaii constitution; this section is thus void and unenforceable. 97 H. 285, 36 P.3d 1255 (2001).</p>
