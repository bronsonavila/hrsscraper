<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§802-7 Litigation expenses.</b> The court may, upon a satisfactory showing that a criminal defendant is unable to pay for transcripts or witness fees and transportation, or for investigatory, expert or other services, and upon a finding that the same are necessary for an adequate defense, direct that such expenses be paid from available court funds or waived, as the case may be; provided that where the defendant is represented by the state public defender or by other counsel appointed by the court except for such other counsel appointed by the court for reasons of conflict of interest on the part of the public defender, the public defender shall pay for or authorize payment for the same, if the public defender determines that the defendant is unable to pay for the same and that the same are necessary for an adequate defense, and if there is a dispute as to the financial ability of the defendant such dispute shall be resolved by the court. In cases where other counsel have been appointed by the court for reasons of conflict of interest, the court may, upon the requisite showing of inability to pay and a finding that such expenses are necessary for an adequate defense as set forth above, direct that such expenses be paid from available court funds or waived, as the case may be.

<p class="XNotes"> Defendant requesting services on basis of indigency is entitled to hearing. 61 H. 203, 600 P.2d 1383 (1979).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant is unable to pay for necessary defense services, defendant may be eligible for court payment even though represented by private counsel. 61 H. 203, 600 P.2d 1383 (1979).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although the language of this section suggests that the court has discretion to direct that transcript expenses are paid, the balance of the pertinent statutory language indicates that once a satisfactory showing of need for the transcripts and inability to pay has been made, the court should direct that such expenses be paid, unless alternative means for timely obtaining the transcripts are available. This is evident as this section mandates that the public defender's office is required to furnish the relevant transcripts upon making the same findings as the court. 131 H. 333, 319 P.3d 252 (2013).</p>
