<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Sections 183D-22 and 183D-10.5 provided the authority for the department of land and natural resources to require payment of a fee for a hunting-related article such as a stamp; however, since game bird hunting was an activity permitted under this chapter, the department was required under this section to adopt a rule pursuant to ยง91-3 when setting the stamp fees for hunting. 117 H. 16 (App.), 175 P.3d 126.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Since the addition of two extra hunting days to each week of the hunting season concerned "conditions for entry into game management areas, and public hunting areas designated by the department of land and natural resources" and "open seasons" for hunting, the express language of this section mandated that in order to add the two weekdays for bird hunting, the department had to amend Hawaii administrative rule 13-122-4 pursuant to chapter 91. 117 H. 16 (App.), 175 P.3d 126.</p>
