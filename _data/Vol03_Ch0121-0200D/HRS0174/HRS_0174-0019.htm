<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§174-19 Administration of project; acreage assessments; liens.</b> All projects established pursuant to this chapter shall be administered by the board of land and natural resources. In making the final determination to establish a project, the board shall determine the proportion of acreage assessments to be borne by the land within the project. The board shall determine and certify to the director of taxation on or before March31 of each year (1) the amount of acreage assessments necessary in that calendar year for acquisition, construction, and maintenance of facilities for each project, and (2) the acreage of each land occupier within the project.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Upon the certification the director of taxation or the director's properly authorized deputies or other assistants, shall determine the acreage assessment to be levied against the property of each land occupier by determining the amount of acreage assessments to be borne by the land within the project according to the proportion previously certified to the director by the board. The acreage assessments shall be collected by the director of taxation in the same manner as state taxes. Except in the case of public lands and lands designated as "available lands" under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, acreage assessments shall be a paramount lien against the entire tract, including improvements, of the land occupier of which the assessed land, or both, of the land occupier included within the projects forms a part. The lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as liens for state taxes and in accordance with sections 231-61 to 231-68. In case of the foreclosure of any homestead land pursuant to such sections the foreclosure sale shall be subject to chapter 171. In the case of public lands and lands designated as "available lands" under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, acreage assessments shall not constitute a lien on the property involved and notice of any delinquent acreage assessment shall be served upon the board of land and natural resources or the Hawaiian homes commission, as the case may be, for payment.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Acreage assessments shall be deemed revenues within the meaning of part III of chapter 39 and shall be used for the payment of the principal and interest of any revenue bonds issued hereunder.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Water tolls fixed by the board for each project under this chapter shall be collected by the board under such reasonable rules and procedures as it may establish and may modify from time to time.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> All water tolls, acreage assessments, and receipts from properties sold by way of foreclosure for failure to pay acreage assessments shall be realizations of the board.
