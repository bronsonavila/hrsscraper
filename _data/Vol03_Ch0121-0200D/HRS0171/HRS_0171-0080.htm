<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง171-80 Cancellation of leases.</b> Whenever the board of land and natural resources has reason to believe that any term or condition of a residential lease has been violated, it shall give notice to the lessee of the suspected violation as provided in section 171-20, and shall afford the lessee an opportunity to be heard. If upon the hearing, the board finds that the lessee has violated the terms and conditions of the lease, it may declare the lessee's interest in the lease and improvements forfeited and order the premises to be vacated within a reasonable time. No such forfeiture shall, however, operate to forfeit the interest of any mortgagee in the lease and improvements, and the board shall pay from the special land and development fund the amount due upon and secured by the mortgage; provided that payment need not be made if a new lease of the premises and improvements is made to a new lessee who is willing to assume, and if the mortgagee is willing to accept the new lessee's assumption of, the mortgage and the debt secured thereby.
