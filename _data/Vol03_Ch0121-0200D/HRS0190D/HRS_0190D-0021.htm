<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The board shall not lease state marine waters unless the board finds that a lease for the proposed activity, after detailed consideration of the present uses, is clearly in the public interest upon consideration of the overall economic, social, and environmental impacts and consistent with other state policy goals and objectives.</p>
