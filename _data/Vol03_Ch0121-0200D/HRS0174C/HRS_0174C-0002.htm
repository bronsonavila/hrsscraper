<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> As water code expressly reserves the counties' authority with respect to land use planning and policy, commission allegedly imposing a "directive" on the counties to designate priorities among proposed uses did not usurp counties' land use planning and zoning authority. 94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Commission did not err in excluding golf course irrigation from the category of "agricultural use". 94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Commission on water resource management's conclusion that "no evidence was presented" to suggest that the rights of native Hawaiians would be adversely affected by permit applicant's proposed use erroneously shifted the burden of proof to complainants; thus, commission failed to adhere to the proper burden of proof standard to maintain the protection of native Hawaiians' traditional and customary gathering rights in discharging its public trust obligations. 116 H. 481, 174 P.3d 320.</p>
