<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Study such other related matters as drainage, reclamation, flood hazards, floodplain zoning, dam safety, and selection of reservoir sites, as they relate to the protection, conservation, quantity, and quality of water.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The water resource protection plan shall include but not be limited to:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Nature and occurrence of water resources in the State;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Hydrologic units and their characteristics, including the quantity and quality of available resource, requirements for beneficial instream uses and environmental protection, desirable uses worthy of preservation by permit, and undesirable uses for which permits may be denied;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Existing and contemplated uses of water, as identified in the water use and development plans of the State and the counties, their impact on the resource, and their consistency with objectives and policies established in the water resource protection and water quality plans;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Programs to conserve, augment, and protect the water resource, including plans for storm water management, reuse, reclamation, and remediation; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Other elements necessary or desirable for inclusion in the plan.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Thereafter, the commission, in coordination with the counties and the department of health, shall formulate an integrated coordinated program for the protection, conservation, and management of the waters in each county based on the above studies. This program, with such amendments, supplements, and additions as may be necessary, shall be known as the water resource protection and water quality plans.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Thereafter, each county shall prepare a water use and development plan and the appropriate state agency shall prepare the state water projects plan.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) The department of agriculture shall prepare a state agricultural water use and development plan for agricultural uses in the State in accordance with chapter 167 and this chapter, and subsequently modify and update the plan as necessary. The state agricultural water use and development plan shall include but not be limited to a master irrigation inventory plan that shall:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Inventory public and private irrigation water systems;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Identify the extent of rehabilitation needed for each system;</p>
