<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง174C-59 Transfer of permit.</b> A permit may be transferred, in whole or in part, from the permittee to another, if:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The conditions of use of the permit, including, but not limited to, place, quantity, and purpose of the use, remain the same; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The commission is informed of the transfer within ninety days.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Failure to inform the commission of the transfer invalidates the transfer and constitutes a ground for revocation of the permit. A transfer which involves a change in any condition of the permit, including a change in use covered in section 174C-57, is also invalid and constitutes a ground for revocation.
