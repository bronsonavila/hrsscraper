<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§144-5 Inspection fees</b> <b>and tonnage reports.</b> (a) There shall be paid to the department for all feeds distributed or imported for use or sale in this State, inspection fees as established by the rules of the department; provided that the department shall exempt by rule the payment of inspection fees on feed not subject to specific requirements of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter. All inspection fees collected shall be deposited with the state director of finance to the credit of the general fund.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Every person, except as hereinafter provided, who distributes or imports for use or sale feed in this State shall:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) File, not later than the last day of January, last day of April, last day of July, and last day of October of each year, quarterly statements, setting forth the number of net tons of feeds distributed or imported in this State during the preceding calendar quarter; and upon filing the statements shall pay the inspection fees. Inspection fees which are due and owing and have not been remitted to the department within thirty days following the due date shall have a penalty fee in an amount established by rules of the department added to the amount due when payment is finally made. The assessment of this penalty fee shall not prevent the department from taking other action as provided in this chapter. When more than one person is involved in the distribution or importation of a feed, the person who imports or distributes to the consumer is responsible for reporting the tonnage and paying the inspection fee unless the report and payment have been made by a prior distributor, seller, or exporter of the feed. The forms used for the quarterly statements shall be provided by the department.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Keep such records as may be necessary or required by rules of the department to indicate accurately the tonnage of feed distributed in this State, and the department shall have the right to examine the records to verify statements of tonnage. Failure to make accurate statement of tonnage or to pay the inspection fee or to comply as provided herein shall constitute sufficient cause for the cancellation of all registrations on file for the distributor and the imposition of administrative penalties.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The department may require the filing of further reports with respect to importation and distribution of feed by carriers, seller's agents, distributors, and named consignees.
