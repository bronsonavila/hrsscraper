<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Hawaiian fishponds" means the unique, traditional system and methodology of aquaculture practiced by the aboriginal people of Hawaii, and found nowhere else in the world. Generally referred to as "loko ia", the system mastered by ancient Hawaiians includes but is not limited to loko kuapa, loko umeiki, and loko puuone. Loko ia are natural or artificial enclosures; loko kuapa are enclosures built upon a reef, loko umeiki are a type of permanent fish-trap structure, and loko puuone are enclosed by sand. The term does not include any fishpond designed in a manner or constructed for purposes other than those associated with traditional loko ia management and culture.<b> </b>[L 1995, c 177, pt of §2]</p>
