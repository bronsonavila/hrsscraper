<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§187A-23 Konohiki rights.</b> (a) The fishing grounds from the reefs, and where there happens to be no reefs, from the distance of one geographical mile seaward of the beach at low watermark, in law, shall be considered the private fishery of the konohiki, whose lands by ancient regulations, belong to the same. These vested fishing rights for the private fishery must be established by proceedings in conformity with section 96 of the Organic Act, and for which judgment has been entered in any circuit court. The established private fishery shall not be disturbed, except to the extent of the reservations and prohibitions set forth in this section, or by law or rule.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The konohiki shall be considered in law to hold the private fishery for the equal use by the konohiki and the tenants on their respective lands, and the tenants shall be allowed to take for home consumption or commercial purposes, any aquatic life of the fisheries, subject to the restrictions imposed by the konohiki as provided in this section, or by law or rule.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) A konohiki each year may set apart one given species or variety of aquatic life natural to the private fishery, by giving public notice by posting at least three written or printed notices in conspicuous places on the land or fishery, to the tenants and others residing on the land, signifying by name, the kind of aquatic life which has been set apart for exclusive use by the konohiki; provided that the konohiki may not reserve more than one kind of aquatic life, if the konohiki possesses other private fisheries which are immediately adjacent to each other. The notice shall be substantially in the following form:</p>
