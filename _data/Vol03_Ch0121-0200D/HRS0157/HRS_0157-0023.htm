<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§157-23 License fees.</b> In order to meet the expenditures necessary to administer this chapter, the board of agriculture shall establish license fees to be paid by producers, producer-distributors and distributors. In determining these fees, the board shall, at least thirty days before the new license year begins:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Project the reasonable expenditures necessary to administer the chapter for the license year;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Project the amount to be paid by applicants for original or renewal licenses for the license year;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Project the reasonable expenditures necessary to conduct an independent monthly audit;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Estimate the total volume of milk to be produced and processed for the license year;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Using (1), (2), (3), and (4) above, establish a reasonable rate per hundred-weight or other unit as determined by the board; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) Collect such fees monthly, or at such other intervals as may be determined by the board, during the license year based on actual milk produced and processed.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> To facilitate the collection of license fees, the board may require a producer-distributor or distributor to withhold from any payment owing to any producer a part or all of the license fee due under this chapter by such producer. For any such withholding required by the board, the producer-distributor or distributor shall be paid a reasonable fee by the board. The amount of the fee shall be set by the board. An agricultural cooperative all of whose producer-members have complied with the licensing provisions of this chapter shall be exempt from the payment of the license fee.
