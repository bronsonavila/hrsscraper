<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§182-2 Mineral rights reserved to the State.</b> (a) All minerals in, on, or under state lands or reserved lands are reserved to the State; provided that the board may release, cancel, or waive the reservation whenever it deems the land use, other than mining, is of greater benefit to the State as provided for in section 182-4. The minerals are reserved from sale or lease except as provided in this chapter. A purchaser or lessee of the lands shall acquire no right, title, or interest in or to the minerals. The right of the purchaser or lessee shall be subject to the reservation of all the minerals and to the conditions and limitations prescribed by law providing for the State and persons authorized by it to prospect for, mine, and remove the minerals, and to occupy and use so much of the surface of the land as may be required for all purposes reasonably extending to the mining and removal of the minerals therefrom by any means whatsoever.</p>
