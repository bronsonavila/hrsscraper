<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§182-4 Mining leases on state lands.</b> (a) If any mineral is discovered or known to exist on state lands, any interested person may notify the board of the person's desire to apply for a mining lease. The notice shall be accompanied by a fee of $100 together with a description of the land desired to be leased, the minerals involved, and any information and maps that the board by rule may prescribe. As soon as practicable thereafter, the board shall cause a public notice to be given in the county where the lands are located, at least once in each of three successive weeks, setting forth the description of the land, and the minerals desired to be leased. The board may hold the public auction of the mining lease within six months from the date of the first notice or any further time that may be reasonably necessary. Whether or not the state land sought to be auctioned is then being utilized or put to some productive use, the board, after due notice of public hearing to all parties in interest, within six weeks from the date of the first notice or any further time that may be reasonably necessary, shall determine whether the proposed mining operation or the existing or reasonably foreseeable future use of the land would be of greater benefit to the State. If the board determines that the existing or reasonably foreseeable future use would be of greater benefit to the State than the proposed mining use of the land, it shall disapprove the application for a mining lease of the land without putting the land to auction. The board shall determine the area to be offered for lease and, after due notice of public hearing to all parties in interest, may modify the boundaries of the land areas. At least thirty days prior to the holding of any public auction, the board shall cause a public notice to be given in the State at least once in each of three successive weeks, setting forth the description of the land, the minerals to be leased, and the time and place of the auction. Bidders at the public auction may be required to bid on the amount of annual rental to be paid for the term of the mining lease based on an upset price fixed by the board, a royalty based on the gross proceeds or net profits, cash bonus, or any combination or other basis and under any terms and conditions that may be set by the board.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Any provisions to the contrary notwithstanding, if the person who discovers the mineral discovers it as a result of exploration permitted under section 182-6, and if that person bids at the public auction on the mining lease for the right to mine the discovered mineral and is unsuccessful in obtaining such lease, that person shall be reimbursed by the person submitting the highest successful bid at public auction for the direct or indirect costs incurred in the exploration of the land, excluding salaries, attorney's fees, and legal expenses. The department may review and approve all expenses and costs that may be reimbursed.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an application for a mining lease submitted pursuant to this section may be granted by the board in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 171-95.3.
