<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§182-13 Surrender of mining leases.</b> Any lessee of a mining lease, who has complied fully with all the terms, covenants, and conditions of the existing lease, may, with the consent of the board, surrender at any time and from time to time all or any part of a mining lease or the land contained therein upon payments as consideration therefor two years' rent prorated upon the portion of the lease or land surrendered. The lessee shall thereupon be relieved of any further liability or duty with respect to the land or lease so surrendered; provided that nothing herein contained shall constitute a waiver of any liability or duty the lessee may have with respect to the land or lease surrendered as a result of any previous activities conducted on the land or under the lease. Upon the termination, cancellation, or surrender of any mining lease or any portion thereof, the lessee shall have the right to remove any and all equipment, buildings, and plants placed on the land surrendered by the holder of the mining lease. A mining lease may also be surrendered if as a result of a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, the lessee is found to have acquired no rights in or to the minerals on reserved lands, nor the right to exploit the same, pursuant to the lease, and, in such event, the lessee shall be reimbursed for rentals paid to the State pursuant to the lease.
