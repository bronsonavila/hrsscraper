After such meeting, if the department determines that there is a need for the district and public sentiment favors its creation, it shall define the boundaries for the proposed district. Should the department deny any petition to organize a district, subsequent petitions covering the same or substantially the same area may be filed with the department after six months after the date of the denial of the petition.
