<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> The plain language and legislative history of this section and §143-15 made very clear that legislature intended to authorize county reliance upon private humane societies to impound stray dogs within their borders; this can be accomplished only if §§76-16(17) and 76-77(10) are interpreted broadly. Att. Gen. Op. 97-6.</span></p>
