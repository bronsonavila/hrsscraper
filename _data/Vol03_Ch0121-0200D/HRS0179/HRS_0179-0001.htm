<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the coordination by the State of all federal and state flood control projects undertaken in Hawaii and for such technical or financial assistance to its political subdivisions as may be desirable or necessary to assure maximum benefits to the people of the State from the expenditure of state funds for flood control purposes.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any political subdivision through its proper officials from requesting federal aid on its own initiative and at its own expense without having to secure state approval.
