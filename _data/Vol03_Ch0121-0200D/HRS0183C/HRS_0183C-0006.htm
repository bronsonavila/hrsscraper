<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although subsection (b) references the "hold[ing] [of] a hearing" as part of the permitting process for uses in the conservation district, it does not mandate one; the court could not read the statute to require a hearing for all permit applications in the absence of mandatory language directing the agency to do so. 131 H. 193, 317 P.3d 300 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The university's conservation district use application necessitated a hearing required by law, i.e., by the administrative rules governing the department of land and natural resources and board of land and natural resources. 131 H. 193, 317 P.3d 300 (2013).</p>
