<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง261E-10] Transfer of certificates of public convenience and necessity; carrier property; control of carriers.</b> (a) No Hawaii air carrier shall sell, lease, assign, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of, or encumber any certificate, in whole or in part, or any of its property necessary or useful in the performance of transportation services for the public; nor shall any Hawaii air carrier, by any means, directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate its property, certificates, or any part thereof, with any other carrier, without in each case first having secured from the air carrier commission an order authorizing it to do so, and every such sale, lease, assignment, mortgage, disposition, encumbrance, merger, or consolidation, made other than in accordance with an order of the commission authorizing the same, shall be void and of no effect.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) No Hawaii air carrier shall purchase or acquire, take, or hold any part of the capital stock of any other common carrier without having been first authorized to do so by the commission. Every assignment or transfer of any stock by or through any person to any person, or otherwise, in violation of this section shall be void and of no effect, and no such transfer shall be made on the books of any air carrier. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the holding of stock lawfully acquired prior to the effective date of this chapter.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) No person shall acquire control of any Hawaii air carrier without first receiving the approval of the commission.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Whenever a transaction is proposed under subsection (a), (b), or (c), the Hawaii air carrier or carriers, or person or persons, seeking approval shall present an application to the commission in the form prescribed by the commission. The commission may act upon the application with or without first holding a public hearing; provided that, if requested, the commission shall afford reasonable opportunity for interested parties to be heard. If the commission finds, subject to the terms and conditions that it determines to be just and reasonable, that the proposed transaction will be consistent with the public interest, the commission shall enter an order approving and authorizing the transaction, upon the terms and conditions and with the modifications found to be just and reasonable. The proponent of the transaction within the scope of subsection (a), (b), or (c) shall have the burden of proof to establish that the transaction is consistent with the public interest.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Pending the determination of an application filed with the commission for approval of a consolidation or merger of the properties of two or more Hawaii air carriers, or of a purchase, lease, charter, or contract to operate the properties of one or more Hawaii air carriers, or of an acquisition of control of a Hawaii air carrier, the commission, in its discretion and without hearings or other proceedings, may grant temporary approval for a period not exceeding one hundred twenty days, or for an additional period as the determination of an application may require, of the operation of the Hawaii air carrier properties sought to be acquired by the persons proposing in the pending application to acquire the properties, if it appears that failure to grant this temporary approval may result in destruction of or injury to the Hawaii air carrier properties sought to be acquired or substantial interference with their future usefulness in the performance of adequate and continuous service to the public.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) This section shall apply to any transaction entered into or proposed to be entered into by a related company that is determined by the commission to have potential impact upon the related Hawaii air carrier or its operations. A related company shall notify the commission of any such transaction at least sixty days prior to its consummation. [L Sp 2008, c 1, pt of ยง2]</p>
