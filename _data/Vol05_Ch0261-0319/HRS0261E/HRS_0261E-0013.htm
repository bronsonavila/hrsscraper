<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง261E-13] Tariffs.</b> (a) Every Hawaii air carrier shall file with the air carrier commission, and keep open to public inspection, tariffs showing all the rates, fares, and charges for transportation, and all services in connection therewith, of passengers or property. The rates, fares, and charges shall be stated in terms of lawful money of the United States. The tariffs required by this section shall be published, filed, and posted in the form and manner and shall contain the information that the commission shall prescribe by rule. The commission may reject any tariff filed with it that is inconsistent with this section. Any tariff rejected by the commission shall be void and its use shall be unlawful.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) No change shall be made in any rate, fare, charge, or classification, or any rule, or practice affecting the rate, fare, charge, or classification, or the value of the service thereunder, specified in any effective tariff of a Hawaii air carrier, except after thirty days notice of the proposed change filed and posted in accordance with subsection (a). The commission, in its discretion and for good cause shown, may allow the change upon notice less than that specified or modify the requirements of this section with respect to posting and filing of tariffs, either in particular instances or by general order applicable to special or peculiar circumstances or conditions.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) No Hawaii air carrier shall engage in the transportation of persons or property unless the rates, fares, and charges upon which the same are transported by the carrier have been filed and published in accordance with this chapter.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Whenever any schedule is filed with the commission stating a new rate, fare, or charge for the transportation of passengers or property by a Hawaii air carrier or any rule or practice affecting the rate, fare, or charge, or the value of the service thereunder, the carrier, on its own initiative may, or by order of the commission served prior to the effective date of the schedule shall, concurrently file an economic justification that shall be prepared under the same form and in the same manner as prescribed by the commission unless the changed fare or rate is within the zone of fare or rate flexibility established pursuant to section 261E-12(g).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Except as provided in section 261E-12(g), the commission, upon complaint of any interested person or upon its own initiative at once and, if it so orders, without answer or other formal pleading by the interested carrier or carriers, but upon reasonable notice, may enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of the rate, fare, or charge, or the rule or practice, and pending the hearing and decision the commission, may suspend the operation of the schedule and defer the use of the rate, fare, or charge, or the rule or practice, by delivering to the affected carrier or carriers not later than five days prior to the effective date of the schedule, a statement in writing of its reasons for the suspension. The commission shall have up to six months from the date of ordering a hearing to investigate the lawfulness of the rate, fare, or charge, to complete its investigation. If the commission fails to issue a final order within the six-month period then the changes proposed by the carrier shall go into effect. At any hearing involving a change in a rate, fare, charge, or classification, or in a rule or practice, the burden of proof shall be upon the carrier to show that the proposed changed rate, fare, charge, classification, rule, or practice is just and reasonable. In exercising its authority under this subsection and subsection (e), the commission shall consider the factors regarding reasonableness set forth in section 261E-12(e).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) When a fare or rate increase application is filed, the commission, in its discretion, may authorize temporary increases in rates, fares, and charges, upon a prima facie showing by a Hawaii air carrier that such fares, rates, or charges are just and reasonable; provided that the commission by order shall require the carrier to keep an accurate account of all amounts received from the increase. The commission, after hearing and decision, shall require a carrier to refund the portion of the increased rates or charges found to be not justified to persons in whose behalf the amounts were paid.
