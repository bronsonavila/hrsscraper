<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where department of transportation's (DOT) counsel made an offer of proof that administrative services officer for DOT would testify that public hearings and comments occur as part of the process for adopting procedures, this stipulated offer of proof supported the circuit court's finding that the DOT procedures included a public comment and informational hearing and, therefore, the finding did not constitute clear error. 134 H. 255 (App.), 339 P.3d 1056 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the department of transportation (DOT) interpreted this section as not prohibiting the DOT from operating Dillingham Airfield as a state airport facility and collecting fees, charges, and rents imposed by its procedures, and in light of the DOT's consistent practice of assessing landing fees at Dillingham Airfield, the circuit court did not err by determining that the DOT's assessment of landing fees at Dillingham Airfield against plaintiffs did not constitute a violation of subsection (a)'s prohibition against applying the DOT "rules" to federally owned or operated airports. 134 H. 255 (App.), 339 P.3d 1056 (2014).</p>
