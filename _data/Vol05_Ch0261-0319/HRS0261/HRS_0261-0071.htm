<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§261-71 Custody and disposal of abandoned aircraft.</b> (a) Any aircraft:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Which has been left unattended for a continuous period of more than thirty days, and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Which is located upon an airport, as defined in section [261-1], under the jurisdiction or control of the State,</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">may be deemed abandoned and taken into custody and disposed of by the director of transportation pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Upon taking custody of any such aircraft a written notice shall immediately be posted on the aircraft and a duplicate original thereof shall be sent by certified mail, with a return receipt, to the registered owner of the aircraft at the last address shown on the records of the Federal Aviation Administration or to such other address known to the department of transportation which is more current; to all lien holders who have filed a financing statement indexed in the name of the registered owner in the state bureau of conveyances or who are shown on the records of the Federal Aviation Administration; and to any other person known to have any interest in the aircraft whose address is known to the department of transportation. The notice shall contain a brief description of the aircraft, the location of custody, and the intended disposition of the aircraft if not repossessed within twenty days after the mailing of the notice. A notice need not be sent to any purported owner or any other person whose interest in the aircraft is not recorded with the Federal Aviation Administration or not known to the department of transportation.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The department may assess and recover as against the owner of the aircraft, all airport use charges, landing fees, holding room use charges, towing, handling, aircraft storage charges, appraisal, advertising and other reasonable expenses incurred by the department in connection with the aircraft.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) If the aircraft is not repossessed within twenty days after the mailing of the notice, the aircraft shall be disposed of by public auction, through oral tenders, or by sealed bids, after public notice has been given; provided that the public auction shall not be held less than five days after public notice is given. Where no bid is received, the aircraft may be sold by negotiation, disposed of as junk, or donated to any governmental agency.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Any person having an interest in the aircraft may take possession of the aircraft prior to the date of public auction upon payment to the department of transportation of all airport use charges, landing fees, holding room use charges, towing, handling, aircraft storage charges, appraisal, advertising and other expenses chargeable to the aircraft or incurred by the department in connection with the aircraft. If the person taking possession of the aircraft is not the registered owner, that person shall, prior to taking possession of the aircraft, pay the foregoing fees, charges and expenses and post adequate security which shall not exceed the value of the aircraft. The security, if not forfeited, shall be returned two years after receipt.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) Public auction shall not be required when the appraised value of any aircraft, as determined by an independent appraiser who has had at least one year of experience in the sale or purchase of aircraft, is less than $100. Upon that determination and after public notice has been given, the director of transportation may sell the aircraft by negotiation, dispose of it as junk, or donate the aircraft to any governmental agency.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) The transfer hereunder shall be evidenced by a bill of sale from the department of transportation, shall be considered a transfer by operation of law and shall be governed by provisions applicable thereto. [L 1981, c 25, pt of §1; am L 1998, c 2, §§77, 78]</p>
