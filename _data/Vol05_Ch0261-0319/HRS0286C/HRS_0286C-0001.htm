<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (a) The party states find that:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The safety of their streets and highways is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state laws and local ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles.</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) It is the policy of each of the party states to:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states.</p>

The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license.</p>
