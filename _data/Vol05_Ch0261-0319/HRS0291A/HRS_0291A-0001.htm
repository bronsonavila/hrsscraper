<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center"><b>NONRESIDENT VIOLATOR COMPACT</b></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center">ARTICLE I. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (a) The party states find that:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Under present procedures, a nonresident motorist who is arrested in a state other than the nonresident's home state must either post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at some later date, or, if unable to post such collateral or bond, the nonresident is taken into custody until collateral or bond is posted or taken directly to court for arraignment to be held. The purpose of this requirement is to obviate the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the nonresident who, if permitted to continue on the nonresident's way after receiving such citation, could return to the nonresident's home state and disregard with impunity the nonresident's duty under the terms of the citation.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) A motorist receiving a traffic citation in the motorist's home state is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the motorist's way after being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The practice described in paragraph (1) causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, causes a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) The arrest of a nonresident motorist for a motor vehicle violation is presently consuming an undue amount of law enforcement time.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) It is the policy of each of the party states to:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Make the reciprocal recognition of the right of motorists of the party states to accept a citation without delay in all traffic violation cases in which such procedure is permitted whether the motorist is a resident or a nonresident of the state in which the arrest was made.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Maximize effective utilization of law enforcement personnel and assist the court systems in the efficient disposition of traffic violations.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Consider an operator who ignores or refuses a citation from a party state to be an unfit or irresponsible person to hold a license to drive.</p>
