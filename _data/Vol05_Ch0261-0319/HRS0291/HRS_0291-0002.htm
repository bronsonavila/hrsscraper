<p class="XNotes"> Officer's additional observations, considered in concert with the reasonable inferences arising from defendant's screeching of tires, warranted an objectively reasonable suspicion that defendant had, at a minimum, committed the offense of reckless driving of a vehicle, in violation of this section; thus, officer's investigative stop was within the parameters of permissible police conduct. 102 H. 228, 74 P.3d 980.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The reckless state of mind definition under §702-206(3) (1993) applies to this reckless driving statute; in determining whether an identified risk is substantial and unjustifiable under §702-206(3), the nature and degree of the risk disregarded by the actor, the nature and purpose of the actor's conduct, and the circumstances known to the actor in acting must be weighed. 113 H. 321, 151 P.3d 802.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where a reckless state of mind could be inferred from the circumstances to conclude that there was conscious awareness of a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety of others and property on the part of defendant, and deference must be given to the trier of fact with respect to questions of credibility and weight of the evidence, there was substantial evidence to find defendant guilty of reckless driving in violation of this section. 113 H. 321, 151 P.3d 802.</p>
