<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[§304A-110] Indemnification. </b>(a) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the board of regents may agree in writing to an indemnity provision by which the university agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless any person, corporation, or entity that sponsors research at the university when all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The person, corporation, or entity requires an indemnity in writing as a condition for providing a grant, benefit, service, or interest in or right to use property;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The president, or the president's designee, following a favorable review by the university general counsel or the counsel's designee, approves the proposed indemnification; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The chief financial officer, pursuant to section 304A‑108, has obtained an insurance policy or policies in an amount sufficient to cover the liability of the university that may be reasonably anticipated to arise under the indemnity provision or has determined that it is not in the best interest of the university to obtain insurance.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to expand the scope of liability of the university beyond that set forth in chapters 661 and 662.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to waive the immunity of the university from suit in federal courts guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. An indemnity provision not in strict compliance with this section shall not give rise to a claim against the university under this chapter or chapter 661 or otherwise waive the university's sovereign immunity.
