<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The work program shall provide for a systematic planning interface among the ongoing planning activities of the counties, the state department of transportation, and the council itself. The work program shall include specific target dates for the provision of identified planning inputs from the responsible state and county functional agencies into the statewide planning process. In determining this schedule, the council shall solicit from the counties their present transportation planning schedules for intra-county systems, and the council's work program shall reflect the counties' existing work product schedule and planning cycles.
