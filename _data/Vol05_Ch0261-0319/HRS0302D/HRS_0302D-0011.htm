<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> [ยง302D-11] Oversight of public charter school authorizers. </b>(a) The board shall be responsible for overseeing the performance and effectiveness of all authorizers established under this chapter.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) In accordance with section 302D-7, every authorizer shall submit to the board and the legislature an annual report. The board shall communicate to every authorizer the requirements for the format, content, and submission of the annual report.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Persistently unsatisfactory performance of an authorizer's portfolio of public charter schools, a pattern of well-founded complaints about the authorizer or its public charter schools, or other objective circumstances may trigger a special review by the board. In reviewing or evaluating the performance of authorizers the board shall apply nationally recognized principles and standards for quality charter authorizing. If at any time the board finds that an authorizer is not in compliance with an existing charter contract, its authorizing contract with the board, or the requirements of all authorizers under this chapter, the board shall notify the authorizer in writing of the identified problems, and the authorizer shall have reasonable opportunity to respond to and remedy the problems.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) If an authorizer persists, after due notice from the board, in violating a material provision of a charter contract or its authorizing contract with the board, or fails to remedy other identified authorizing problems, the board shall notify the authorizer, within a reasonable amount of time under the circumstances, that it intends to revoke the authorizer's chartering authority unless the authorizer demonstrates a timely and satisfactory remedy for the violation or deficiencies.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) In the event of revocation of any authorizer's chartering authority, the board shall manage the timely and orderly transfer of each charter contract held by that authorizer to another authorizer in the State, with the mutual agreement of each affected public charter school and proposed new authorizer. The new authorizer shall enter into a new charter contract with the charter school for the remainder of the charter term. [L 2012, c 130 pt of ยง2]</p>
