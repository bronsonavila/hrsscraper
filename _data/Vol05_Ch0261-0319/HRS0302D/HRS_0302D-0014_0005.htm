<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) An applicant governing board shall not be considered an entity of the State, but shall have the authority to execute the initial charter contract; provided that the term of duration of the initial charter contract shall not exceed five years, not including the pre-opening period. Upon the execution of the initial charter contract, the applicant governing board shall become the governing board of the newly established pre-opening charter school.
