<p class="XNotes"> Charges against defendant for accidents involving bodily injury and driving without a license were insufficient for failing to allege a mens rea and, therefore, were subject to dismissal without prejudice. 134 H. 465 (App.), 342 P.3d 884 (2015).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> When viewed in the light most favorable to the State, there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant acted with at least a reckless state of mind regarding whether defendant had been "involved in an accident resulting in bodily injury to any person", where the evidence showed: (1) defendant struck complaining witness twice when defendant backed vehicle into complaining witness; (2) defendant's vehicle hit complaining witness on the side of complaining witness' leg and knee; (3) complaining witness' friend confronted defendant about hitting complaining witness; and (4) complaining witness experienced physical pain and was taken to the hospital. 134 H. 465 (App.), 342 P.3d 884 (2015).</p>
