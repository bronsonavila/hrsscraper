<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) There would be a maximization of the use of available lands if a state agency were to be authorized to acquire, hold and manage energy corridors consisting of lands or interest therein, thereby controlling the use thereof;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Competition would be fostered and thereby a reduction in cost to consumers would be realized if the State could make available energy corridors as the location for the facilities necessary for the transportation of sources of energy;</p>
