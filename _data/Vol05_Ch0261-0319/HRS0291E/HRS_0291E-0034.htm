<p class="XNotes"> As Honolulu police department form 396B explains the essential difference between the civil nature of the revocation proceeding and the penal characteristics of the criminal proceeding, the various consequences that flow from each, and the interrelationship between the two with respect to driving privileges, the form satisfies the directive of subsection (a)(2) that "general information" about the "distinction" between the two be explained. 108 H. 78, 117 P.3d 109.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Honolulu police department form 396B need not notify drivers that the police must establish reasonable suspicion to stop and probable cause to believe a driver is under the influence of an intoxicant in an administrative license revocation hearing, in the absence of a statutory directive to that effect. 108 H. 78, 117 P.3d 109.</p>
