<p class="XNotes"> This section does not authorize law enforcement officers conducting sobriety checkpoints to pursue and detain drivers of motor vehicles appearing to avoid the sobriety checkpoints in a lawful manner; permitting officers to do so was beyond the lawful scope of the statutory procedures and, therefore, more intrusive than the standards and guidelines described in this section and violative of §291E-19. 113 H. 283, 151 P.3d 764.</p>
