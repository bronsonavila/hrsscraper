<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Honolulu police department form 396B prohibiting operation of "a vehicle" in the event of license revocation did adequately put defendant on notice that the term "vehicle" includes mopeds and vessels, as the term "vehicle" is a term of ordinary usage and broad enough to inform a person of ordinary intelligence that it would include a means of ground transportation such as a moped. 108 H. 78, 117 P.3d 109.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although the oral charge tracked the language of §291E-61, where the charge failed to allege that defendant was driving defendant's vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense, the charge was deficient, as the term "operate" as defined in this section did not comport with its commonly understood definition, required the conduct to take place "upon a public way, street, road, or highway", and was neither "unmistakable" nor "readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding". 121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section establishes an attendant circumstance of the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), i.e., that the defendant's conduct occur "upon a public way, street, road, or highway"; the definition of "operate" in this section refers generally to the conduct of "operating" a vehicle under the influence as described in the title of §291E-61, whether the conduct consists of driving the vehicle or otherwise assuming actual physical control of it; thus, the operation of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII and therefore an element of the offense. 121 H. 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009).</p>
