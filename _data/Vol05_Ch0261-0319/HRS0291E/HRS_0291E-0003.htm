<p class="XNotes"> Where a plain reading of this section indicates that the phrase "any proceeding under part III" refers to administrative license revocations, trial court erred in upholding hearing officer's ruling that subsection (c) applies only to criminal prosecutions and has no application to administrative driver's license revocation office cases. 109 H. 220, 124 P.3d 965.</p>
