<p class="XNotes"> An appellate court's remand for entry of judgment of conviction and resentencing for a lesser-included offense must be based on a jurisdictionally valid lesser-included charge; where defendant's charge under this section did not adequately allege the lesser-included offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant as a first offender under §291E-61 because the charge failed to allege an essential element, specifically, the attendant circumstance that defendant operated a vehicle on a public road, way, street, or highway, the appellate court did not err in vacating and remanding circuit court case. 126 H. 475, 273 P.3d 1161 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where, under §701-114(1)(a), proof of each element of an offense is required for a conviction, and the term "habitual" or "habitual operator" in the indictment did not convey the narrow definition that the person charged with habitually operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant had to have three or more convictions within the previous ten years, the phrase "habitual operator" did not provide adequate notice to defendant what the State was required to prove as an element of the offense; thus, defendant's conviction vacated. 128 H. 132 (App.), 284 P.3d 905 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Discussed: 133 H. 102, 324 P.3d 912 (2014).</p>
