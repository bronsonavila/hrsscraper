<p class="XNotes"> As to the description of the offense, this section, which relates to operating a vehicle after license and privilege have been suspended or revoked for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, substantially reenacted §291-4.5, which pertained to driving after license suspended or revoked for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 107 H. 36, 109 P.3d 677.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Prior qualifying convictions for operating a vehicle after license and privilege have been suspended or revoked for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, in violation of this section, are an essential offense element that must be alleged in the charging instrument in order to impose the enhanced penalties for repeat offenders under this section. 124 H. 404 (App.), 245 P.3d 477 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the State's amendment before trial of charges under §291E-61 and this section to allege the requisite mens rea did not affect defendant's ability to prepare a defense and did not prejudice defendant's substantial rights, the district court did not err in permitting the State to amend the charges. 134 H. 280 (App.), 339 P.3d 1081 (2014).</p>
