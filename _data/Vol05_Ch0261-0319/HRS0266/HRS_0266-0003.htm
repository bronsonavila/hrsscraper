<p class="XNotes"> Where the department of transportation's (DOT) governing statutes did not explicitly or implicitly authorize the DOT to issue administrative rules exonerating the State from the negligence of its employees, Hawaii administrative rule §19-41-7 did not bear a reasonable relationship to the DOT's statutory mandate, and the legislature's imposition of a statutory duty to defend and/or indemnify in other circumstances demonstrated the legislature's clear intent to reserve such power to itself, trial court erred in obligating appellants to defend and indemnify the State against injured plaintiff's claims. 111 H. 144, 140 P.3d 377.</p>
