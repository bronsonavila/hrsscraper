<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (a) The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, then the action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Not later than thirty days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission's authority.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the interstate commission; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.

If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:</p>

A cure of the default shall not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.</p>
