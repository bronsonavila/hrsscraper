<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The i<span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">nterstate</span> commission, by a majority of the members, shall elect annually from among its members a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson or, in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice-chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the interstate commission. The officers elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the interstate commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for ordinary and necessary costs incurred by them in the performance of their responsibilities as officers of the interstate commission.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The executive committee shall have such authority and duties as may be set forth in the bylaws, including:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Managing the affairs of the interstate commission in a manner consistent with the bylaws and purposes of the interstate commission;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Overseeing an organizational structure within, and appropriate procedures for, the interstate commission to provide for the creation of rules, operating procedures, and administrative and technical support functions; and</p>

The executive director shall hire and supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the interstate commission.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) The interstate commission's executive director and its employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct of such person:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (l) The liability of the interstate commission's executive director and employees or interstate commission representatives, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within the person's state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. The interstate commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct of such person;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The interstate commission shall defend the executive director and its employees and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an interstate commission representative, shall defend such interstate commission representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person; and</p>

<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center"><b>RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</b></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (a) The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, then the action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Not later than thirty days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission's authority.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.</p>

<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center"><b>OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (a) Oversight:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules adopted hereunder shall have the force and effect of law;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the interstate commission; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Default, technical assistance, suspension, and termination. If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default shall not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its [principal] offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (h) Dispute resolution:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states and between member and non-member states; and</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (i) Enforcement:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its [principal] offices, to enforce <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">compliance with the provisions of this compact, its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees</span>; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.</p>
