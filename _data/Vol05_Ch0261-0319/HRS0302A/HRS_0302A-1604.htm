<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The need to construct new or expand existing school facilities in the proposed <span class="1ParagraphChar">school impact district</span> area within the next twenty-five years to accommodate projected growth in the area based on various state and county land use, demographics, growth, density, and other applicable <span class="1ParagraphChar">historical data</span> projections and plans;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) An analysis to determine appropriate student generation rates by dwelling unit type for all new residential developments in the school impact district area to provide the basis for determining the steady state enrollment generated by new residential developments that will need to be accommodated.

<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) Calculation of the current statewide level of service;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) An analysis of appropriate school land area, or other appropriate state lands, and enrollment capacity, which may include nontraditional (i.e., mid-rise or high-rise structures) facilities to accommodate the need for public school facilities in high-growth areas within existing urban developments;</p>
