<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> The parents of a disabled student were entitled to reimbursement for the costs of the student's private school program, where the decision to enroll the student at that program was bilateral, rather than unilateral; thus, the one hundred eighty day limitations period did not apply. The department of education knew that the student was enrolled at the program for the school year. By waiting so long into the school year to propose a different placement, the department tacitly consented to the student's enrollment at the private program. 788 F.3d 1033 (2015). </p>
<p class="XNotes"> Student's placement at a private school was bilateral due to hearing officer's approval in July 2006, and therefore, plaintiffs' request for tuition reimbursement was subject to the two-year statute of limitations in subsection (a)(1); plaintiffs' request was timely. 550 F. Supp. 2d 1238 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Section did not apply as the state statute of limitations in actions for attorney's fees under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 621 F. Supp. 2d 1013 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff parents' claim that Act 129 (L 2011) was invalid, in that it allowed the department of education to withhold stay put payments if monitoring was not allowed, was not ripe for judicial review. Plaintiffs failed to establish that they or their child would suffer harm from department of education's actions regarding Act 129, L 2011. 897 F. Supp. 2d 1004 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As claim that health department was legally obligated to pay for child's services at private residential treatment center arose under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and child did not pursue the remedies available under the federal act to establish health department's obligation to pay for the services, family court lacked jurisdiction to order the department to pay for the services. 96 H. 272, 30 P.3d 878.</p>
