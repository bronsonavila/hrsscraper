<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff asserted that this section and §290-9 were unconstitutional and that the municipality was subject to liability under 42 U.S.C. §1983 on the grounds that an ordinance implemented the sections and therefore constituted an official policy statement by the municipality; no basis found for imposing liability on the municipality under 42 U.S.C. §1983. 333 F. Supp. 2d 942.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section and §290-9 are not facially unconstitutional except for condition (6) set forth in this section, which allows for the immediate disposition, without notice, of derelict cars older than ten years and unconstitutionally violates the requirements of due process. 333 F. Supp. 2d 942.</p>
