If the driver is physically incapable of making the report, any other occupant in the vehicle at the time of the accident capable of making the report shall make or cause to be made the report not made by the driver, and the registered owner of the motor vehicle involved in the accident shall, unless the report is filed, within ten days after learning of the accident make the report. The driver, occupant, and registered owner shall furnish such additional relevant information as the chief of police or administrator shall require.
