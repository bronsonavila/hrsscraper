<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §281-75 Analyses.</b> Whenever the liquor commission or investigator thereof has reason to believe or suspect, on complaint or otherwise, that any liquor being manufactured or which is possessed or kept for sale by any licensee is or may be impure or adulterated or otherwise not conformable to any lawful requirement, the commission or investigator thereof or other person authorized in writing by the commission or by the investigator may secure a sample thereof for analysis. Upon such sample being obtained, as though by ostensible purchase or otherwise, the person procuring the same shall immediately disclose to the licensee the person's office or authority and purpose, and in case the procurer is a person other than the commission or the investigator the procurer shall then deliver to the licensee a copy of the written order for the procurement of the sample. The bottle or other container containing the sample shall then and there be sealed by the procurer thereof before being taken from the premises of the licensee and the licensee may also attach the licensee's seal thereto.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The investigator shall cause the sample so obtained to be immediately delivered with the seal or seals unbroken to the state department of health or some competent analyst employed by the commission who shall make an analysis of the liquor and shall send a certified report thereof to the investigator, who shall immediately file the same with the commission's administrator.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> If the sample analyzed is found pure and unadulterated and conformable with all legal requirements for such liquor, the certificate referred to in the preceding paragraph shall so state, and the commission shall pay to the licensee a sum equal to the value of the sample, and if requested by the licensee the administrator shall furnish the licensee a copy of the analysis.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> If the certificate of analysis shows the sample to be impure or adulterated or contrary to any legal requirement the licensee shall be prosecuted for selling, or offering for sale, or furnishing forbidden liquor in violation of this chapter.
