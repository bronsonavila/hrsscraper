<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง269-102 Standard contract or tariff; rate structure.</b> (a) Every electric utility shall develop a standard contract or tariff providing for net energy metering and shall make this contract available to eligible customer-generators, upon request, on a first-come-first-served basis until the time that the total rated generating capacity produced by eligible customer-generators equals .5 per cent of the electric utility's system peak demand; provided that the public utilities commission may modify, by rule or order, the total rated generating capacity produced by eligible customer-generators; provided further that the public utilities commission shall ensure that a percentage of the total rated generating capacity produced by eligible customer-generators shall be reserved for electricity produced by eligible residential or small commercial customer-generators. The public utilities commission may define, by rule or order, the maximum capacity for eligible residential or small commercial customer-generators. Notwithstanding the generating capacity requirements of this subsection, the public utilities commission may evaluate, on an island-by-island basis, the applicability of the generating capacity requirements of this subsection and, in its discretion, may exempt an island or a utility grid system from the generating capacity requirements.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Each <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">net</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-weight:normal">energy</span></strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight:normal">metering</span></strong> contract or tariff shall be identical, with respect to rate structure, to the contract or tariff to which the same customer would be assigned if the customer was not an eligible customer-generator. The charges for all retail rate components for eligible customer-generators shall be based exclusively on the eligible customer-generator's <strong><span style="font-weight:normal">net</span></strong> kilowatt-hour consumption over a monthly billing period. Any new or additional demand charge, standby charge, customer charge, minimum monthly charge, interconnection charge, or other charge that would increase an eligible customer-generator's costs beyond those of other customers in the rate class to which the eligible customer-generator would otherwise be assigned are contrary to the intent of this section, and shall not form a part of <strong><span style="font-weight:normal">net</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">energy</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-weight:normal">metering </span></strong>contracts or tariffs.</p>
