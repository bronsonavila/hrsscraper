<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> [ยง269-26.5] Preferential water rates for agricultural activities.</b> (a) It is the policy of the State to promote the long-term viability of agriculture by establishing mechanisms that provide for preferential rates for potable water for agricultural activities. The public utilities commission shall have the authority to establish preferential rates for potable water used for agricultural activities in a public utility's service area.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Upon receipt of a bona fide request for preferential rates for potable water to be used for agricultural activities, and proof that the customer engages in agricultural activities, a public utility shall provide proposed preferential rates for potable water to be used only for qualified agricultural activities to the public utilities commission for approval. All such rates approved by the public utilities commission shall be subsidized by the potable water rates charged to other customers of the public utility if required as determined by the public utilities commission. In reviewing the proposed preferential rates, the public utilities commission, in consultation with the department of agriculture, may establish additional criteria to qualify bona fide agribusinesses for water used solely for agricultural activities. For rate cases initiated pursuant to this section, the public utilities commission shall allow the recovery of any reasonable unamortized costs incurred by the public utility in its previous rate case; provided however, upon full amortization of these costs, rates shall be adjusted accordingly.
