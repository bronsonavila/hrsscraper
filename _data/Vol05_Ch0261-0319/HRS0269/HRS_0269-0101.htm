<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง269-101 Definitions.</b> As used in this part:</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Eligible customer-generator" means a metered residential or commercial customer, including a government entity, of an electric utility who owns and operates a solar, wind turbine, biomass, or hydroelectric energy generating facility, or a hybrid system consisting of two or more of these facilities, that is:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Located on the customer's premises;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Operated in parallel with the utility's transmission and distribution facilities;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) In conformance with the utility's interconnection requirements; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer's own electrical requirements.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Net energy metering" means measuring the difference between the electricity supplied through the electric grid and the electricity generated by an eligible customer-generator and fed back to the electric grid over a monthly billing period; provided that:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Net energy metering shall be accomplished using a single meter capable of registering the flow of electricity in two directions;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) An additional meter or meters to monitor the flow of electricity in each direction may be installed with the consent of the customer-generator, at the expense of the electric utility, and the additional metering shall be used only to provide the information necessary to accurately bill or credit the customer-generator, or to collect solar, wind turbine, biomass, or hydroelectric energy generating system performance information for research purposes;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) If the existing electrical meter of an eligible customer-generator is not capable of measuring the flow of electricity in two directions, the electric utility shall be responsible for all expenses involved in purchasing and installing a meter that is able to measure electricity flow in two directions;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) If an additional meter or meters are installed, the net energy metering calculation shall yield a result identical to that of a single meter; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) An eligible customer-generator who already owns an existing solar, wind turbine, biomass, or hydroelectric energy generating facility, or a hybrid system consisting of two or more of these facilities, is eligible to receive net energy metering service in accordance with this part.
