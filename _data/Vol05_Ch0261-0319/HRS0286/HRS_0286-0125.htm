<p class="XNotes"> As §291C-161(c) requires every person convicted under §291C-105 to be sentenced in accordance with §291C-105, trial court erred in sentencing defendant to a six-month driver's license suspension under this section; the plain language of §291C-105 required the sentencing court to impose the list of sanctions as specific under §291C-105(c), including a thirty-day license suspension for a first-time offender. 121 H. 117 (App.), 214 P.3d 1107 (2009).</p>
