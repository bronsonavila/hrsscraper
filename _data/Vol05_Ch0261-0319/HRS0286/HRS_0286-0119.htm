<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> ยง286-119 Authority of examiner of drivers to suspend or revoke licenses.</b> The examiner of drivers may suspend any driver's license without hearing when the examiner has reasonable cause to believe that the licensee is incompetent to operate the type of motor vehicle for which the licensee holds a license or is afflicted with mental or physical infirmities or disabilities which would make it unsafe for the licensee to operate a motor vehicle of the type for which the licensee is licensed. When the examiner of drivers suspends a license under this section, the examiner shall immediately notify the licensee and afford the licensee a hearing. After the hearing, the examiner of drivers may rescind the suspension, or the examiner may suspend the license for a further period or revoke the license. Any person whose license has been suspended or revoked under this section may appeal under section 286-129. [L 1967, c 214, pt of ยง2; HRS ยง286-119; am L 1970, c 164, ยง3; gen ch 1985]</p>
