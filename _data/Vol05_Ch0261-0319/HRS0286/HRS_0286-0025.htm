<p class="XNotes"> Statute applied to defendant, where defendant argued that traffic statutes involved only applied to businesses and state vehicles; statute did not violate defendants freedom of movement. 77 H. 222 (App.), 883 P.2d 644.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> It is within the power of the legislature to motivate compliance with safety inspection and liability insurance laws by imposing the penalty specified in this section; because the offense of "expired safety sticker" is a civil traffic infraction and not a criminal offense, the district court improperly found motorist "guilty". 107 H. 508 (App.), 115 P.3d 687.</p>
