<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The director of finance shall, upon receipt of the application, or thereafter, furnish to the manufacturer or dealer:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Permanent number plates which shall be attached to new motor vehicles which are used by the applicant only for demonstration of the new motor vehicles to customers upon the public highways if requested by the applicant.

Before issuing the current permanent number plates, the director of finance shall require each applicant to return the permanent number plates issued previously. If any permanent number plates issued previously have been lost or destroyed, the manufacturer or dealer who applies for the permanent number plates shall certify in writing to the director of finance that the permanent number plates have been lost or destroyed and that if any lost permanent number plates are found, they shall be returned forthwith to the director of finance. Upon receipt of the certificate, the director of finance shall issue an equal number of the most current permanent number plates as have been certified to be lost or destroyed.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Whenever a new motor vehicle dealer sells a new motor vehicle to a person, the new motor vehicle dealer shall detach the permanent number plate issued under subsection (c) from that new motor vehicle and replace it with one temporary number plate. The temporary number plate shall be attached to the rear of the vehicle in the same location as required for number plates under section 249-7. The new motor vehicle dealer shall print only the following upon the temporary number plate:</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) No manufacturer or dealer shall permit the operation of any motor vehicle owned or controlled by the manufacturer or dealer upon any public highway, unless permanent number plates assigned to the manufacturer or dealer are attached thereto, in the manner specified in this part; provided that the new vehicles may be operated without permanent number plates attached thereto on the initial continuous movement from the place of entry of the vehicle into this State to the warehouse, storeroom, salesroom, or other place of business selected by the manufacturer or dealer.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) Every manufacturer or dealer, upon the sale, lease, or other transfer by the manufacturer or dealer of a new vehicle registered under a general distinguishing number, as herein provided, shall forthwith give notice of the transfer to the director of finance upon the appropriate official form, stating the date of the transfer, a description of the vehicle, the name and post office address of the transferee, and certifying that temporary number plates have been provided for the motor vehicle of the transferee.</p>
