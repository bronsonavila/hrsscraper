The privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the highways of this State and the several counties, given to a nonresident under the laws of this State, shall be subject to suspension by the district judge in like manner, and for like cause, the same as a driver's license issued by this State may be suspended.</p>

The district judges of each county shall enter into reciprocal agreements with the proper agency of any other county and the governor of the State may enter into such agreements with any state or territory for the purpose of reporting convictions or bail forfeitures in such county, state, or territory by a person holding a driver's license in such county, state, or territory. Such convictions or bail forfeitures in such county, state, or territory of a violation therein which if committed in this State would be a violation of the traffic laws of this State or the ordinances of the several counties, shall be recorded against a driver the same as if the conviction or bail forfeiture had been made in the State.</p>
