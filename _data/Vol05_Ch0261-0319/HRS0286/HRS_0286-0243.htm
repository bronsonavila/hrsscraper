<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) A test or tests may be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer who, after lawfully stopping or detaining the commercial motor vehicle driver, has probable cause to believe that the driver was driving a commercial motor vehicle while having in the person's body alcohol, a controlled substance, or any drug which impairs driving.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) A person requested to submit to a test as provided in subsection (a) shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test will result in:</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) A hearing to determine the truth and correctness of an affidavit of a law enforcement officer submitted under subsection (d) shall be scheduled to commence before a district judge within twenty days after the affidavit is filed or as soon thereafter as is practicable.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The State shall be represented at the hearing by the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the alleged violation occurred. The district judge shall hear and determine:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Whether the law enforcement officer who stopped or detained the driver had probable cause to believe that the driver had been either driving or in actual physical control of a commercial motor vehicle, while having any alcohol in the driver's body;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Whether the law enforcement officer informed the driver of the sanctions of section 286-240;</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs">The amount of alcohol found in the driver's blood within three hours after the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis or other analytical techniques of the defendant's blood or breath shall be competent evidence that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the alleged violation.

If the judge finds the statements contained in the affidavit are true, the judge shall disqualify the driver from driving a commercial motor vehicle as provided by section 286-240.
