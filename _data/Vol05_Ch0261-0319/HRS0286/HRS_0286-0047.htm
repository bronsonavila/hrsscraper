If any of the information subsequently proves to be a typographical error, the dealer, as defined in section 437-1.1, shall notify the director of finance of the error by a written certificate stating the reasons for and nature of the error and the correction which should be made in the certificate of registration and the certificate of ownership. Upon receipt of the dealer's certificate by the director of finance, the certificate of registration and the certificate of ownership shall be corrected accordingly so long as the correction does not constitute a change of the vehicle originally registered.
