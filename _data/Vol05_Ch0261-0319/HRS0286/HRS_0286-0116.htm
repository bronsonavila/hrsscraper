Whenever a person presents a mobile electronic device pursuant to this section, that person assumes all liability for any damage to the mobile electronic device.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Any registered owner of any motor vehicle required to be licensed, who directly or indirectly permits the operation of such motor vehicle on any highway at any time the motor vehicle is not insured in compliance with article 10C and article 10G of chapter 431, shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter.
