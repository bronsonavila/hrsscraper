<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§624-27 Subpoena to witness.</b> Where a commission to take testimony within the State has been issued from a court without the State, or where a notice has been given or any other proceeding has been taken for the purpose of taking testimony within the State, pursuant to the laws or practice of the state or jurisdiction wherein the deposition is to be used for purposes of discovery or as evidence, including the United States if it is a federal proceeding, the circuit court, in a proper case, on the presentation of a verified petition shall order the issuance of a subpoena to any witness, commanding the witness to appear before the commissioner, officer or person named or designated in the commission, notice or other paper, at a time and place specified in the subpoena, to testify in the same manner as is provided by the rules of court relating to depositions for use in [the] State. If any witness fails to obey the subpoena, or refuses to testify, or to produce a book or paper pursuant to a subpoena or to subscribe the witness' deposition, the court issuing the subpoena, if it is determined that a contempt has been committed, may prescribe the punishment as in the case of a recalcitrant witness in a circuit court in the State, and may make such additional or other orders as would be proper if the deposition were for use in the State.
