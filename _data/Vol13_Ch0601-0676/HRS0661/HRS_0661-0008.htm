<p class="XNotes"> Section does not preclude prejudgment interest where the State is not involved. 51 H. 346, 461 P.2d 140 (1969).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As this section disallows prejudgment interest on claims against the State, except in certain, identified instances, the State did not waive its sovereign immunity from an award of prejudgment interest under this section, and §478-2 did not contradict or supersede the limitation of the State's obligation to pay prejudgment interest only upon a "contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest", the circuit court did not err when it denied plaintiffs' request for prejudgment interest. 122 H. 150 (App.), 223 P.3d 215 (2009).</p>
