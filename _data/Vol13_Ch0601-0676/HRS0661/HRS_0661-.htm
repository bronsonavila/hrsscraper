<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff's lawsuit against employees' retirement system was obviously cognizable under this chapter as a claim against the State. 75 H. 42, 856 P.2d 1227 (1993).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court erred in granting plaintiffs the right to sue for breach of contract under this chapter where, with respect to the individual beneficiary claims under chapter 674, the language of Act 14, L Sp 1995 merely indicated the legislature's expressed desire for "title-related" claims to be settled in a timely manner. 111 H. 84, 137 P.3d 990 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where employees' retirement system trustees were alleging in lawsuit that Act 100, L 1999 was unconstitutional as being violative of article XVI, §2 of the Hawaii constitution, their claims were not "founded upon any statute of the State; or upon any regulation of an executive department; or upon any contract" and were not referred to the court by the legislature; thus, trustees' claims were not cognizable under this chapter, and, therefore, were not subject to the statute of limitations set forth in §661-5. 114 H. 302, 162 P.3d 696 (2007).</p>
