The use and operation of the motor vehicle is deemed a signification of the person's agreement that any summons against the person which is served is of the same legal force and validity as if served upon the person personally within this State, whether the person is a nonresident of this State or at the time a cause of action arises is a resident of this State but subsequently becomes a nonresident of this State. Service of such summons is to be made as provided by section 634-36, if the defendant cannot be found in the State.</p>
