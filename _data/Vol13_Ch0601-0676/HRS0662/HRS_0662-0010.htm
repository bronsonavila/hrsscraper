<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiff alleged that plaintiff was sexually assaulted by a youth correctional officer while plaintiff was a minor ward detained at a youth correctional facility, this section did not bar plaintiff from obtaining contemporaneous judgments from defendant in defendant's individual capacity and from the State; to the extent that recovery against the State was predicated on the alleged negligence of defendant's superiors in hiring, supervising, training, and retaining defendant, such a claim did not involve "the same subject matter" as the intentional tort claims against defendant. 133 H. 453, 331 P.3d 431 (2014).</p>
