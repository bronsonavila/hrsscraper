Upon the furnishing of the bond the property shall be relinquished to the defendant who had possession, unless the bond is furnished by another person who has, by proper pleadings, presented an affirmative claim to the property and has complied with the provisions of this chapter applicable to a plaintiff, in which case the court shall determine the custody of the property.
