<p class="XNotes"> Circuit court erred in determining that petitioner's claim that the arbitration provision in question was unconscionable on several grounds were beyond the scope of its review in deciding on a motion to compel arbitration; unconscionability is a generally applicable contract defense and is within the scope of the circuit court's review on the question of whether a valid and enforceable agreement to arbitrate exists. 130 H. 437, 312 P.3d 869 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The circuit court should have granted the petitioner's motion to compel arbitration because there was an arbitration agreement between the parties that clearly and unmistakably left the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator. 132 H. 426, 322 P.3d 966 (2014).</p>
