<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where appellant was already bound by an arbitration agreement executed on February 24, 2000, and therefore the post-July 1, 2002 arbitration agreement was not a "new" arbitration agreement that would dictate the application of this chapter to the arbitration proceedings, ยง658A-3(a) was inapplicable to the case. 113 H. 127, 149 P.3d 495 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where arbitration between the State and union representing state employees was statutorily mandated arbitration pursuant to ยง89-11(e), and not a voluntary agreement to arbitrate, the Hawaii labor relations board had original jurisdiction over the parties' dispute pursuant to ยง89-14; circuit court did not have jurisdiction pursuant to this chapter because this chapter was inapplicable. 134 H. 489, 345 P.3d 155 (2015).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> To the extent that there may be a conflict between the jurisdictional provisions of this chapter and chapter 89, chapter 89 takes precedence over this chapter. 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).</p>
