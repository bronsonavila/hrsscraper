<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where circuit court denied motion to confirm arbitration award and remanded to arbitrator to rehear issue of appropriate remedy, the order denying the motion was not an appealable order and the appellate court lacked appellate jurisdiction under subsection (a). 123 H. 128 (App.), 230 P.3d 428 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where arbitrator explicitly retained jurisdiction to decide the merits of the case, stating in the arbitrator's determination that "I hereby find and conclude that the class grievance is arbitrable on its merits and this matter shall proceed to further arbitration for a determination on the merits of a class grievance", the arbitrator's determination was not an "award" pursuant to subsection (a)(3); thus, appeals court could not review the appeal from the order granting motion to confirm arbitration as the order was unappealable pursuant to subsection (a)(3). 124 H. 367 (App.), 244 P.3d 604 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although public workers' union was not engaged in arbitration proceedings at the time of the other public union's motion to compel consolidated arbitration pursuant to ยง658A-7, as the core purpose of the other public union's motion was to compel arbitration, appeals court had jurisdiction under this section over other public union's appeal from order denying motion for consolidated arbitration. 124 H. 372 (App.), 244 P.3d 609 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As subsection (a) authorizes an appeal from an order confirming an award or from a final judgment entered pursuant to this chapter, given the express language and plain meaning of this section and ยง658A-25, appellants were authorized to appeal from either the order granting confirmation or the final judgment; thus, appellants' notice of appeal was timely with respect to the final judgment. 126 H. 179 (App.), 268 P.3d 432 (2012).</p>
