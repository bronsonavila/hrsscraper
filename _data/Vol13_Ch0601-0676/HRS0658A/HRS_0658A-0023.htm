<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) An arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing upon showing of sufficient cause for postponement, refused to consider evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise conducted the hearing contrary to section 658A-15, so as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;</p>

<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff contended that district court erred in granting defendant's motion to confirm and denying plaintiff's motion to vacate the arbitration award because the arbitrator was biased against plaintiff and failed to follow the law; confirmation of the arbitration award and denial of the motion to vacate the award, affirmed. 603 F.3d 676 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> In the narrow circumstances of the case, perjury may constitute a basis for vacating an arbitration award. 126 H. 99 (App.), 267 P.3d 683 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant failed to allege or establish that the arbitration award itself--i.e., awarding damages in favor of plaintiff--violated any public policy, and alleged that the arbitrator's findings and conclusions were tainted by plaintiff's perjury, the statutory grounds embodied in subsection (a) provided sufficient recourse to vacate awards for fraud, including perjury, and the public policy exception was inapplicable to the case. 126 H. 99 (App.), 267 P.3d 683 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Section provides authority for relief from an arbitration award, but not from a final judgment on an order confirming an arbitration award. 131 H. 301 (App.), 318 P.3d 591 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The arbitrator was expressly authorized by the collective bargaining agreement to award "back pay to compensate the teacher wholly ... for any salary lost" and interpreted the provision to allow interest for the time that the teacher was without pay. Even if the arbitrator incorrectly construed the agreement or misinterpreted applicable law, the arbitrator acted within the arbitrator's power to interpret the agreement and fashion a remedy in accordance with the arbitrator's interpretation. 131 H. 301 (App.), 318 P.3d 591 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where collective bargaining agreement provisions granted arbitrator broad authority to remedy grievances and, pursuant thereto, arbitrator ordered that employees be promoted: (1) employer was not estopped from asserting that the arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's authority in granting remedial promotions; (2) the arbitration award did not violate public policy; and (3) the arbitrator's award did not exceed the arbitrator's authority. 134 H. 155 (App.), 338 P.3d 1170 (2014).</p>
