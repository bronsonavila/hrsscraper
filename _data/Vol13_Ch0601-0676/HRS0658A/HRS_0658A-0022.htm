<p class="XNotes"> Although insurer contended that because award had already been paid, motion to confirm the award had been rendered moot, as the plain language of this section requires the circuit court to confirm an award unless the award has been vacated, modified, or corrected, circuit court did not err in confirming the arbitration award. 122 H. 393 (App.), 227 P.3d 559 (2010).</p>
