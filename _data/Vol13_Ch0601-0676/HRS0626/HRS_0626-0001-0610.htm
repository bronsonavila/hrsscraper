<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b> </b>This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 610, the Advisory Committee's Note to which says:</p>
<p class="XNotes" style="margin-left:.5in">While the rule forecloses inquiry into the religious beliefs or opinions of a witness for the purpose of showing that his character for truthfulness is affected by their nature, an inquiry for the purpose of showing interest or bias because of them is not within the prohibition. Thus disclosure of affiliation with a church which is a party to the litigation would be allowable under the rule.</p>
