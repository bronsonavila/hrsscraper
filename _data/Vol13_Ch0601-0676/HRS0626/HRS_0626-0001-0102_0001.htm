<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b> </b>This rule has no Fed. R. Evid. counterpart. It closely resembles Hawaii Rev. Stat. ยง701-105 (1976), which limits the effect of the penal code commentary because, as the commentary to that section points out, "of the strong judicial deference given legislative committee reports and other evidence of legislative intent authored by the Legislature or its staff." See State v. Aiu, 59 H. 92, 98, 576 P.2d 1044, 1049 (1978); State v. Anderson, 58 H. 479, 483, 572 P.2d 159, 162 (1977); State v. Alo, 57 H. 418, 426-27, 558 P.2d 1012, 1017 (1976); State v. Nobriga, 56 H. 75, 77, 527 P.2d 1269, 1273 (1974).</p>
