<p class="XNotes"><b> </b>This rule is identical with Fed. R. Evid. 1003. It restates a prior statute, Hawaii Rev. Stat. §622-3 (1976) (repealed 1980) (originally enacted as L 1876, c 32, §44; am L 1945, c 17, §1; am L 1972, c 104, §2(c)), which similarly provided for liberal use of facsimile copies in lieu of originals. See Territory v. Morgenstein, 39 H. 602 (1952). "Duplicate" is defined in Rule 1001(4) supra.</p>
