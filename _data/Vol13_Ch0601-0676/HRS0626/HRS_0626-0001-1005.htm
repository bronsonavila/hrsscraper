<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>Rule 1005 Public records.</b> The contents of a public record, if otherwise admissible, may be proved by copy, certified as correct in accordance with rule 902 or testified to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original.

<p class="XNotes"><b> </b>This rule is similar to Fed. R. Evid. 1005 in intent. The "public records" covered are those specified in Rule 1001(5) supra. Since production of original public records would be burdensome to both proponents and public officials, numerous statutes, e.g., Hawaii Rev. Stat. ยง502-82 (1976) (recorded instruments of conveyance) dispense with such a requirement. In this instance, however, a distinct preference for certified or compared copies is expressed.</p>
