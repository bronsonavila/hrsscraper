<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§652-3 Amount withheld.</b> For the purposes of garnishment, if it appears in any cause wherein service has been made as provided by law, whether before or after judgment, upon any garnishee from whom the defendant is in receipt of any wages, the court shall order and direct the garnishee not to withhold more than a portion of the wages of the defendant to be determined as provided for in the third paragraph of subsection (a) of section 652-1. The garnishee shall continue such withholding from the wages of the defendant until the action against the defendant has been finally determined and the final judgment obtained against the defendant, if any, has been fully paid with legal interest thereon. However, no more of the wages shall be withheld from the defendant in advance of final judgment than shall be sufficient to meet the demand of the plaintiff, together with cost and legal interest.
