<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§652-4 Satisfying judgment.</b> In case there is certified to any garnishee a judgment for the plaintiff, from or to which no appeal or execution at the time of its rendition, has been noted the garnishee shall pay to the plaintiff such sums as theretofore have been sequestered and not drawn against in pursuance of the action if the judgment equals or exceeds such sums. If the amount sequestered and not drawn against does not suffice to extinguish the judgment, then such sequestration and delivery to the plaintiff by the garnishee of a sum equal to the percentage of wages required to be withheld by section 652-1 shall continue from week to week, or from month to month, until the judgment, with legal interest thereon, is fully paid, or until the defendant quits the service of and dissolves the defendant's relation to the garnishee upon which sequestration is founded.
