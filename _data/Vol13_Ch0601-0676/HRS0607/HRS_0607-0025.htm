<p class="XNotes"> Under this section, attorneys' fees may be awarded to: (1) a member of the public who prevails against a private party who has been or is undertaking development without obtaining all permits or approvals required by law from governmental agencies; and (2) a defendant private party who prevails against a plaintiff who has brought a frivolous suit. 86 H. 132, 948 P.2d 122 (1997).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiff's claims were not frivolous, award of attorneys' fees to defendants not warranted under this section. 86 H. 132, 948 P.2d 122 (1997).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where nothing in this section indicates that this section should provide the exclusive means for awarding attorney's fees and costs against a party for a violation of chapter 343, this section was not the exclusive means for awarding attorney's fees and costs for violations of chapter 343; also, this section did not prevent an award of attorney's fees against defendant Superferry pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine. 120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226 (2009).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where there was no record in the case that defendant Superferry qualified under subsection (e) as a private party that was "undertaking development without obtaining all permits or approvals required by law", trial court erred in awarding plaintiff attorney's fees and costs against defendant based on this section. 120 H. 181, 202 P.3d 1226 (2009).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> In the circumstances of the case, art. XI, §9 of the Hawaii constitution created a private right of action to enforce chapter 205, and the legislature confirmed the existence of that right of action by enacting this section, which allows for the recovery of attorneys' fees in such actions; chapter 205 is a law relating to environmental quality within the meaning of art. XI, §9, section 9 is self-executing, and §205-12 imposes "reasonable limitations and regulations" that were applicable to the case which allowed the private right of action to enforce chapter 205. 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010).</p>
