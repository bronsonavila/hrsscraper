<p class="XNotes"> Although expenditures for airfare, parking, rental car, and gas clearly fall within this sections "intrastate travel expenses" category, meals are not taxable costs and should have been deducted from attorneys award of costs for travel expenses. 114 H. 202, 159 P.3d 814 (2007).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney costs for "messenger services" where it was reasonable for trial court to have allowed a portion of the cost for the expense of mailing the numerous filings from Oahu to Hawaii, the trial court had actually reduced the amount of the requested costs, and despite having detailed itemized invoice information for these services, defendants did not provide any evidence that any specific delivery costs were unnecessary or unreasonable. 114 H. 202, 159 P.3d 814 (2007).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney court reporter expenses where, despite having detailed itemized invoice information for this service, defendants only made a general objection and did not indicate which of the depositions were unreasonably obtained or unnecessary; defendants thus failed to carry their burden of showing that the trial court abused its discretion. 114 H. 202, 159 P.3d 814 (2007).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although refusing to assess the costs of the depositions against non-prevailing party petitioner was within the courts discretion if the court found that the depositions were not necessarily obtained for use at trial or that to do so would be inequitable, it was error under this section for the court to deny costs to the prevailing party respondent without justification, unless the circumstances justifying the denial of the costs were plain from the record; thus, issue remanded to allow the court to set forth the reasons for not assessing petitioner the deposition costs of petitioner and two doctors. 128 H. 423, 290 P.3d 493 (2012).</p>
