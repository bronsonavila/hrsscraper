The fees for attendance shall be the same as the fees of witnesses before the circuit courts of this State. The summons shall issue in the name of the arbitral tribunal or panel and be signed by a majority of them, shall be directed to such person, and shall be served in the same manner as subpoenas to testify before a court of record. If any person so summoned to testify refuses or neglects to obey the summons, upon petition the circuit court may compel the attendance of such person before the arbitral tribunal or panel, or punish such person for contempt in the same manner now provided for the attendance of witnesses or the punishment of them in the circuit court.
