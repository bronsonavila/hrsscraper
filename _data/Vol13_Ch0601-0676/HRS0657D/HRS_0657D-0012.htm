<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง657D-12]</b> <b>Stay of proceedings where military service affects conduct thereof.</b> In any action or proceeding in any court in which a person in military service is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, during the period of that service or within sixty days thereafter, the court in its discretion, on application to it by the person or a person on such person's behalf, shall stay the action or proceeding at any stage as provided in this chapter. No stay shall issue if, in the opinion of the court, the ability of the plaintiff to prosecute the action or the defendant to conduct the defense is not materially affected by reason of the person's military service.
