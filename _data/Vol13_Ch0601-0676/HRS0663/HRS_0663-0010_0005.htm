<p class="XNotes"> The plain language of this section's nonretroactivity clause focuses upon the specific "acts or omissions" that predicate a plaintiff's claim, and, therefore, the clause's applicability is not keyed to when the plaintiff's cause of action "accrues"; thus, trial court erred in apportioning liability between department of education (DOE) and teacher and DOE was liable to plaintiffs for the full extent of their damages. 100 H. 34, 58 P.3d 545 (2002).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section, which abolishes joint and several liability for government entities, did not supersede or impliedly repeal (1) §663-10.9(4), which expressly allows for recovery of non-economic damages in motor vehicle accidents involving the maintenance and design of highways, or (2) §663-10.9(1), that provides for the recovery of economic damages against joint tortfeasors in actions involving injury or death to persons. 110 H. 97, 129 P.3d 1125 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs' negligence claim included the right to recover under an unmodified doctrine of joint and several liability, as at the time their claim accrued, this section (2005) imposed joint and several liability for economic and noneconomic damages upon any jointly liable person; thus, because the legislature did not intend for Act 112, L 2006 to apply retroactively to divest the plaintiffs' accrued or substantive rights, the trial court correctly concluded that Act 112 did not apply to the case. 117 H. 262, 178 P.3d 538 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where patient's estate was entitled to recover under the doctrine of joint and several liability in place at the time of patient's injury, trial court did not err in holding defendant hospital jointly and severally liable. 127 H. 325 (App.), 278 P.3d 382 (2012).</p>
