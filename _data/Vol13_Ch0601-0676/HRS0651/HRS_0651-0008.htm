<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§651-8 Amount levied on.</b> The police officer shall attach a sufficient amount of the property of the defendant if a sufficient amount of property not exempt from execution can be found, giving preference to property to which the defendant has an unquestionable title over any property to which the defendant's title is doubtful. The police officer, as nearly as the circumstances of the case will permit, shall levy upon property twenty per cent greater in value than the amount that the plaintiff in the plaintiff's affidavit claims to be due. When property is seized on attachment, the court may allow reasonable and just compensation to the officer having charge of the property for the officer's trouble and expenses in keeping the property.
