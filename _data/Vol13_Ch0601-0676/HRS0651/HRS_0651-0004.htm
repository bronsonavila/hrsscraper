With the bond or undertaking, there shall also be filed the affidavits of the sureties, as provided in section 78-20.

Subject to section 651-5, in any case where the amount for which the plaintiff demands judgment is in excess of $50,000, the court may, upon motion of the plaintiff, enter an order permitting a bond, conditioned as herein provided, in a sum as fixed in the order of less than the amount hereinabove set forth; provided that the bond shall in any event be not less than an amount equal to one and one-half times the value of the property of the defendant proposed to be attached as shown to the satisfaction of the court entering the order.
