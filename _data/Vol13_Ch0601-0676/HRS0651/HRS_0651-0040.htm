<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§651-40 Stay by judge; effect.</b> Any judge of a court of record may, by order at chambers, in any cause in which an execution has been issued, grant a stay thereof in the officer's hands, for equitable reasons, when no appeal or writ of error is granted, upon the defendant giving bond and security for its payment with costs up to the stay. The property levied upon shall not be released from the levy by the stay of execution, and in case at the end of the time accorded the condition of the bond be not complied with, the plaintiff in execution may elect whether to proceed to the sale of the levied property, or to enforce the bond; provided that if the levied property is not sufficient to pay the judgment, with all costs, expenses, and commissions, the stay inclusive, the sureties in the bond shall be answerable for the deficiency. And when justice may require the renewal of any execution, or an extension of the time for making return to any execution, any judge of a court of record shall have power so to order.
