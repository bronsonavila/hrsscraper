<p class="XNotes"> A writ of execution cannot properly be levied after the return day; once the return day of an execution passes, it becomes functus officio and confers no authority on the officer to whom it is directed; correlatively, a levy accomplished after the return day is invalid and a sale based thereon is void. 102 H. 518, 78 P.3d 331 (2003).</p>
