<p class="XNotes"> Where four joint defendants joined in each of ten challenges, held that they had exercised their full right of challenge, although each would have been allowed ten challenges if taken separately. 3 H. 90 (1869).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Circuit court plainly erred where, during jury selection, it removed two jurors for cause on the motion of respondent after the jury panel already had been passed for cause, and defendant and respondent had already exhausted their peremptory challenges; this procedure violated rule 24 of the HRPP, which provides that challenges for cause may be made at any time prior to the exercise of peremptory challenges, and in effect abrogated the parity in the number of peremptories each side is guaranteed pursuant to this section. 127 H. 415, 279 P.3d 683 (2012).</p>
