<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The attendance of the persons at the hearing of the design claim conciliation panel;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The extent to which representatives of parties and counsel representing parties came to panel hearings with knowledge of the claims and defenses and authority to negotiate a settlement or other disposition of the claim;</p>
