<p class="XNotes"> Amendment reducing period of infancy, during which statute of limitations is tolled, from twenty to eighteen years had effect of accelerating the date on which the limitation statute commences to run so that action not brought within two years after plaintiff had reached eighteen was barred. 58 H. 101, 564 P.2d 1276 (1977).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Because the city is neither the sovereign nor the surrogate or alter ego of the sovereign, it is not entitled to sovereign immunity; thus, it is subject to the State's tort laws in the same manner as any private tortfeasor; as this section governs classes of "personal" tort actions, such as "damage to persons or property", the infancy tolling provision of paragraph (1) applies directly to personal injury actions against the city; child was thus able to bring action, but as paragraph (1) did not provide for tolling of parents' derivative actions and they did not timely comply with §46-72, their individual claims were barred. 104 H. 341, 90 P.3d 233 (2004).</p>
