<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> The statutory scheme and legislative history of ยง386-8 indicated that the phrase "except as limited by [this] chapter" was not intended to restrict an employee's right to intervene in a lawsuit that was timely filed by his or her employer; thus, employee was not barred by the statute of limitations under ยง657-7 to intervene in plaintiff insurer's timely filed suit, and the circuit court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment. 126 H. 406, 271 P.3d 1165 (2012).</p>
