<p class="XNotes"> The fact that the question of who was responsible for payment for particular services received by the children could be decided independently from the need for the family court's continuing jurisdiction, coupled with the importance of obtaining a definitive ruling on the issue, established that the "requisite degree of finality" was present to permit appellate jurisdiction. 96 H. 272, 30 P.3d 878 (2001).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court's order was appealable under subsection (a) as it granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion, ordering return of garnished funds, awarding costs, and denying request for attorneys' fees, disposing of all issues raised in the motion; order left nothing further to be accomplished and was, therefore, final. 103 H. 153, 80 P.3d 974 (2003).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Order was interlocutory where it decided liability but left relief pending. 5 H. App. 20, 674 P.2d 1024 (1984).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Not enlarged or modified by HRCP rule 54; where case involves multiple claims or parties, appellate jurisdiction of those fully decided claims or rights must be based on satisfaction of HRCP rule 54 requirements. 5 H. App. 222, 686 P.2d 37 (1984).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Probate court's decision that a parcel of real property is not part of decedent's estate is an appealable collateral order. 83 H. 412 (App.), 927 P.2d 420 (1996).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff's appeal of causation order untimely where plaintiff's notice of appeal was filed within thirty days of written order granting plaintiff's motion for leave to file interlocutory appeal, but not within thirty days of order appealed from. 86 H. 301 (App.), 949 P.2d 141 (1997).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where Hawaii supreme court entered an order dismissing the appeal of an order selling property, on the ground that "a final judgment closing the proceeding has not been entered" and the "order approving the sale of real property was an interlocutory order that was not certified for interlocutory appeal", appellate court did not have jurisdiction to decide the point on appeal. 105 H. 507 (App.), 100 P.3d 77 (2004).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where all claims against all parties had not been finally decided when the notices of appeal were filed, appellate court did not have appellate jurisdiction and appeal was dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 112 H. 367 (App.), 145 P.3d 910 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Circuit court's order, to the extent that it denied defendant's request to compel arbitration, was an appealable order where order fell within a small class of orders that were appealable because "the rights conferred by chapter 658 [repealed], if applicable, would be lost, probably irreparably" if the party was required to wait until final judgment to effectively review the order. 118 H. 308 (App.), 188 P.3d 822 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Circuit court erred, where it approved a stipulation to extend the deadline for submitting plaintiff's notice of appeal without requiring a showing of good cause, as required by HRAP rule 4(a)(4)(A). 126 H. 92 (App.), 267 P.3d 676 (2011).</p>
