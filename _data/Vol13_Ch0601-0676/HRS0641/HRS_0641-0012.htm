<p class="XNotes"> The supreme court does not have jurisdiction to entertain appeals from interlocutory orders of the district courts in criminal cases. 57 H. 133, 552 P.2d 75 (1976); 62 H. 297, 613 P.2d 362 (1980).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant's interlocutory appeal from district court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds did not satisfy prerequisites of collateral order exception, supreme court did not have to decide whether exception may apply to appeals from collateral orders of district court. 82 H. 446, 923 P.2d 388 (1996).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where sentence imposed was not the final sentence because the district court expressly left open the possibility that its sentence of defendant might include an order requiring defendant to pay restitution, and the court did not finally decide whether it would order defendant to pay restitution and, if so, in what amount, the judgment was not final and, because it was not final, it was not appealable. 109 H. 435 (App.), 127 P.3d 95 (2005).</p>
