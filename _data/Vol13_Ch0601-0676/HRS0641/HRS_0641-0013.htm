<p class="XNotes"> While it is necessary for "entire case" to be dismissed for paragraph (2) to apply, there is nothing in the language of this section to indicate that this would prevent paragraph (1) from applying; prosecution not barred from bringing appeal of dismissal of counts of indictment, where counts dismissed after trial began because counts did not include essential elements of offenses charged. 78 H. 373, 894 P.2d 70 (1995).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> The language of paragraph (7), which allows the prosecution to appeal from "a pretrial order granting a motion for the suppression of evidence", includes within its scope the right to appeal from a trial courts voluntariness determination mandated by §621-26. 104 H. 224, 87 P.3d 893 (2004).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> As the prosecution was not authorized to appeal the judge's pretrial discovery order under this section, the prosecution, as mandamus petitioner, would have been without a remedy unless extraordinary relief was granted; where trial judge did not exceed judge's authority under HRPP rule 16(d) by ordering the disclosure of the information on the laser unit calibration distances and locations in prosecution of defendant for speeding, petition for writ of mandamus was denied. 116 H. 23, 169 P.3d 975 (2007).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the case was a criminal matter filed by plaintiff State of Hawaii against defendant and the police department (HPD) was not a party to the case, HPD, as a nonparty, was not authorized to appeal the respondent judge's order denying HPD's motion to quash defendant's subpoena duces tecum pursuant to §641-11 if judgment was entered against defendant; HPD was also not authorized to appeal the order pursuant to the interlocutory appeal statute for defendants, §641-17, or the appeal statute for the prosecution under this section; thus, having no remedy by way of appeal, HPD properly sought redress from the order by mandamus. 122 H. 204, 225 P.3d 646 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Deferred acceptance of no contest plea not appealable until no contest plea accepted. 5 H. App. 357, 692 P.2d 1171 (1984).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Paragraph (9) did not preclude appellate court's jurisdiction over State's appeal where trial court's judgment of acquittal was "in form only and not in substance"; trial court made no factual determination as to some or all of the elements charged, but grounded its ruling on the conclusion that the charges were defective as a matter of law. 88 H. 477 (App.), 967 P.2d 674 (1998).</p>
