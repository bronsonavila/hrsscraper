<p class="XNotes"> Claim was allowed to be heard because there was substantial compliance with procedural requirements. 69 H. 305, 741 P.2d 1280 (1987).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where certain counts of plaintiff's complaint alleged errors or omissions in professional practice by a health care provider, thus falling under the definition of "medical tort" under §671-1(2), court properly ruled plaintiff could not proceed with those counts of suit without first submitting them to medical claim conciliation panel as required by §671-12 and this section. 89 H. 188, 970 P.2d 496 (1998).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiff chose to sidestep requirements of §671-12 and this section by filing suit before seeking resolution of claims by a medical claim conciliation panel as required under these statutes, court properly dismissed complaint. 89 H. 188, 970 P.2d 496 (1998).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff's claims of neglect, abuse, and failure to provide a safe home against care home defendants did not constitute "medical torts" within the meaning of §671-1; thus, plaintiff was not required to submit plaintiff's claims to a medical claim conciliation panel (MCCP) pursuant to §671-12 and this section as a condition for plaintiff to file suit against defendants, and the circuit court erred in dismissing plaintiff's suit based on plaintiff's failure to submit plaintiff's claims to a MCCP. 128 H. 405 (App.), 289 P.3d 1041 (2012).</p>
