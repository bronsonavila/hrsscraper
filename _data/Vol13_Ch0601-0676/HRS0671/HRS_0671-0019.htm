<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The attendance of the persons at proceedings of the medical inquiry and conciliation panel;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The extent to which representatives of parties and counsel representing parties came to panel proceedings with knowledge of the claims and defenses and authority to negotiate a settlement or other disposition of the matter;</p>
