<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) A health maintenance organization shall file notice, with adequate supporting information, with the commissioner prior to the exercise of any power granted in subsection (a)(1), (2), or (4) which may affect the financial soundness of the health maintenance organization. The commissioner shall disapprove such exercise of power only if in the commissioner's opinion it would substantially and adversely affect the financial soundness of the health maintenance organization and endanger its ability to meet its obligations. If the commissioner does not disapprove the request within thirty days of the filing of the notice, it shall be deemed approved. The commissioner may adopt rules exempting from the filing requirement of this subsection those activities having a minimal effect. [L 1995, c 179, pt of ยง1]</p>
