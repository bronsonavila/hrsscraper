<p class="XNotes"> As this chapter does not cover the field of managed care regulation and because §§432D-2, 432E-1, and article 431:10A can be read together and there is no explicit language or policy reason not to give each statute effect, this chapter does not repeal chapter 432E by implication. 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Properly licensed HMOs, like plaintiff, were authorized pursuant to §432D-1 to "provide or arrange", at their option, for the closed panel health care services required under the managed care plan program; accident and health insurers were authorized under §431:10A-205(b) to arrange for medical services for members using a defined network of providers, i.e., particular "hospitals or persons"; thus, article 431:10A and this chapter authorized both accident and health insurers and HMOs, as risk-bearing entities, to provide the closed panel product required by the managed care plan contracts. 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621 (2012).</p>
