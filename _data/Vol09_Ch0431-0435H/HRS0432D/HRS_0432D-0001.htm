<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Reading this section in pari materia with §432D-8, the Hawaii legislature did not intend to eliminate the enforcement of an implied contract between a participating provider and a health maintenance organization. To hold that only written contracts are valid would render the "implied contract" phrase in this section [definition of "participating provider"] meaningless because §432-8 would bar the enforcement of such an implied contract. 948 F. Supp. 2d 1131 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Properly licensed HMOs, like plaintiff, were authorized pursuant to this section to "provide or arrange", at their option, for the closed panel health care services required under the managed care plan program; accident and health insurers were authorized under §431:10A-205(b) to arrange for medical services for members using a defined network of providers, i.e., particular "hospitals or persons"; thus, article 431:10A and chapter 432D authorized both accident and health insurers and HMOs, as risk-bearing entities, to provide the closed panel product required by the managed care plan contracts. 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621 (2012).</p>
