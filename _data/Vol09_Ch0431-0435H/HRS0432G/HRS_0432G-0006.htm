Any securities shall be approved by the commissioner before being deposited or substituted;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) The deposit shall be used to protect the interests of the dental insurer's enrollees and to assure continuation of dental care services to enrollees of a dental insurer which is in rehabilitation or conservation. The commissioner may use the deposit for administrative costs directly attributable to a receivership or liquidation. If the dental insurer is placed in receivership or liquidation, the deposit shall be an asset subject to the provisions of article 15 of chapter 431; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) The commissioner may reduce or eliminate the deposit requirement if the dental insurer deposits with the director of finance of this State, or the commissioner, or other official body of the state or jurisdiction of domicile of such dental insurer, for the protection of all subscribers and enrollees, wherever located, cash, acceptable securities, or surety, and delivers to the commissioner a certificate to such effect, duly authenticated by the appropriate state official holding the deposit.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Every dental insurer, when determining liabilities, shall include an amount estimated in the aggregate to provide for any unearned premium and for the payment of all claims for dental care expenditures which have been incurred, whether reported or unreported, which are unpaid and for which the organization is or may be liable, and to provide for the expense of adjustment or settlement of claims. These liabilities shall be computed in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner upon reasonable consideration of the ascertained experience and character of the dental insurer.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Every contract between a dental insurer and a participating provider shall be in writing and shall set forth that in the event the dental insurer fails to pay for dental care services as set forth in the contract, the subscriber or enrollee shall not be liable to the provider for any sums owed by the dental insurer. In the event that a contract with a participating provider has not been reduced to writing as required by this subsection or that a contract fails to contain the required prohibition, the participating provider shall not collect or attempt to collect from the subscriber or enrollee sums owed by the dental insurer. No participating provider, or agent, trustee, or assignee thereof, may maintain any action at law against a subscriber or enrollee to collect sums owed by the dental insurer.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) The commissioner shall require that each dental insurer have a plan for handling insolvency which allows for continuation of benefits for the duration of the contract period for which premiums have been paid.

The commissioner may prescribe the forms on which the reports are to be prepared. Every dental insurer shall maintain a copy of its current net solvency report on the premises of its primary place of business.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (h) The commissioner may order an examination, subject to article 2 of chapter 431, to determine whether a dental insurer is in compliance with this section.
