<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> [§432G-15] Administrative fines and enforcement.</b> (a) The commissioner, in addition to or in lieu of suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority pursuant to section 432G‑13, may levy an administrative fine upon a dental insurer in an amount not less than $500 and not more than $50,000. The dental insurer may request, in writing, a hearing pursuant to section 432G‑13. The order levying the fine shall specify the period within which the fine shall be fully paid, which shall not be less than thirty nor more than forty-five days from the date of the order. Upon failure to pay the fine when due, the commissioner shall revoke the insurer's certificate of authority if not already revoked, and the fine shall be recovered in a civil action brought on behalf of the commissioner. Any fine so collected shall be remitted by the commissioner to the director of finance and shall be placed to the credit of the compliance resolution fund.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) If the commissioner, for any reason, has cause to believe that any violation of this chapter has occurred or is threatened, the commissioner may give notice to a dental insurer and its representatives, or other persons who appear to be involved in such suspected violation, to arrange a conference with the alleged violators or their authorized representatives for the purpose of attempting to ascertain the facts relating to any suspected violation. In the event it appears that any violation has occurred or is threatened, the commissioner may attempt to arrive at an adequate and effective means of correcting or preventing the violation. Proceedings under this subsection shall not be governed by any formal procedural requirements and may be conducted in such manner as the commissioner may deem appropriate under the circumstances. However, unless consented to by the dental insurer, no order may result from a conference until the requirements of this section are satisfied.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The commissioner may issue an order directing a dental insurer or a representative of a dental insurer to cease and desist from engaging in any act or practice in violation of the provisions of this chapter. Any person aggrieved by an order of the commissioner under this section may obtain judicial review of the order in the manner provided for by chapter 91.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) In the case of any violation of the provisions of this chapter, if the commissioner elects not to issue a cease and desist order, or in the event of noncompliance with a cease and desist order issued pursuant to subsection (c), the commissioner may institute a proceeding to obtain injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
