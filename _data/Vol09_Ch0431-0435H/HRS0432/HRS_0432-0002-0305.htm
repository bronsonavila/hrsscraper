<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) If the commissioner finds that the contract is in conformity with the provisions of this section, that the financial statements are correct and that the consolidation or merger is just and equitable to the members of each society, the commissioner shall approve the contract and issue a certificate to such effect. Upon such approval, the contract shall be in full force and effect, unless any society which is a party to the contract is incorporated under the laws of any other state or territory. In such event the consolidation or merger shall not become effective unless and until it has been approved as provided by the laws of such state or territory and a certificate of such approval filed with the commissioner of this State, or, if the laws of such state or territory contain no such provision, then the consolidation or merger shall not become effective unless and until it has been approved by the commissioner of insurance of such state or territory and a certificate of such approval filed with the commissioner of this State.</p>
