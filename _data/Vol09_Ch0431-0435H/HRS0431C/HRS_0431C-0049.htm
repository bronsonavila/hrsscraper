<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Any person damaged by the acts of another person in violation of this chapter or any rule implementing this chapter, may bring a civil action for damages against the person committing the violation in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The commissioner may issue a cease and desist order upon a person who violates any provision of this chapter, any rule or order adopted by the commissioner, or any written agreement entered into with the commissioner, in accordance with chapter 91.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) When the commissioner finds that such an action presents an immediate danger to the public and requires an immediate final order, the commissioner may issue an emergency cease and desist order reciting with particularity the facts underlying such findings. The emergency cease and desist order shall be effective immediately upon service of a copy of the order on the respondent and shall remain effective for ninety days. If the commissioner begins non-emergency cease and desist proceedings under subsection (a), the emergency cease and desist order shall remain effective, absent an order by an appellate court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to chapter 91. In the event of a wilful violation of this chapter, the trial court may award statutory damages in addition to actual damages in an additional amount up to three times the actual damage award. The provisions of this chapter may not be waived by agreement. No choice of law provision may be used to prevent the application of this chapter to any life settlement contract in which a party to the settlement is a resident of this State.
