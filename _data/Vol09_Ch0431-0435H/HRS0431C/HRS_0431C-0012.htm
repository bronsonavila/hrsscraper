<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง431C-12] Conduct of examinations.</b> (a) Upon determining that an examination under section 431C-11 should be conducted, the commissioner shall issue an examination warrant appointing one or more examiners to perform the examination and instructing them as to the scope of the examination. In conducting the examination, the examiner shall use methods common to the examination of any life settlement licensee and shall use the guidelines and procedures set forth in an examiners' handbook adopted by a national organization.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Every licensee or person from whom information is sought, including its officers, directors, employees, and agents, shall provide to the examiners timely, convenient, and free access at all reasonable hours at its offices to all books, records, accounts, papers, documents, assets, and computer or other recordings relating to the property, assets, business, and affairs of the licensee being examined. The officers, directors, employees, and agents of the licensee or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The refusal of a licensee, by its officers, directors, employees, or agents, to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the commissioner shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the licensee to engage in the life settlement business or other business subject to the commissioner's jurisdiction. Any proceedings for suspension, revocation, or refusal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 91.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The commissioner shall have the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths, and to examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the examination. Upon the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) When making an examination under this chapter, the commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants, or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the examination.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend an examination to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this State. Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or licensee work papers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action that the commissioner may, in the commissioner's sole discretion, deem appropriate.
