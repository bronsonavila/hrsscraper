Every contract between a managed care plan and a participating provider of health care services shall require the participating provider to comply with the managed care plan's requests for any information necessary for the managed care plan to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The State shall require that:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Consumers, providers, managed care plans, purchasers, and regulators shall be equitably represented in the development of standards; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Standards shall result in measurement and reporting that is purposeful, valid, and scientifically based, applied in a consistent and comparable manner, efficient and cost effective, and designed to minimize redundancy and duplication of effort.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) All managed care plans, no less than annually, shall report to the commissioner comparable information on performance, including measures of quality, outcomes, access, satisfaction, and utilization of services; provided that:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Reporting shall be based upon a core data and information set that builds upon nationally recognized performance measurement systems. The core data and information set shall include standardized measures of:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) Effectiveness and appropriateness of care (the impact of care delivered to managed care plan enrollees, for example, results of the plan for childhood immunizations, cholesterol screening, mammography screening, cervical cancer screening, prenatal visits in the first trimester of pregnancy, and diabetic retinal examinations);</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) Access and availability of care (the extent to which plan enrollees have access to the health care providers they need or desire to see, and receive appropriate services in a timely manner, without inappropriate barriers or inconvenience);</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph">  (C) Satisfaction with the experience of care (the results of the most recent enrollee satisfaction survey using standardized survey design and methods);</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (D) Managed care plan stability (attributes of a managed care plan which affect its ability to deliver high-quality care and service on a sustained basis);</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (E) Use of services (rates of service use per one thousand enrollees as well as percentages of enrollees who receive specified services);</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (F) Cost of care (expenditures per enrollee per month, premium rates for selected membership categories, and rates of increases); and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (G) Managed care plan descriptive information (the plan name, location of headquarters, and number of years the plan has been in business; the model type of the plan; the counties in which the plan operates; the total number of participating physicians per one thousand enrollees and the number of primary care physicians per one thousand enrollees; the number of participating hospitals per ten thousand enrollees; the percentage of participating physicians who are board certified; and a list of wellness and health care education programs offered by the plan);</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Information shall be uniformly reported by managed care plans in a standardized format, as determined by rule;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Information supplied by managed care plans shall be subject to independent audit by the appropriate regulatory agency or its designee to verify accuracy and protect against misrepresentation;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Information reported by managed care plans shall be adjusted, based on standardized methods, to control for the effects of differences in health risk, severity of illness, or mix of services;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) A managed care plan shall ensure confidentiality of records and shall not disclose individually identifiable data or information pertaining to the diagnosis, treatment, or health of any enrollee, except as provided under law; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) A managed care plan shall disclose to its enrollees the quality and satisfaction assessments used, including the current results of the assessments. [L 1998, c 178, pt of ยง2; am L 1999, c 137, ยง8]</p>
