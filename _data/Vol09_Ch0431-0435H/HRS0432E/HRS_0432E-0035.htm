<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) An adverse determination that involves a medical condition of the enrollee for which the time frame for completion of an expedited internal appeal would seriously jeopardize the enrollee's life, health, or ability to gain maximum functioning or would subject the enrollee to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the adverse determination;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) A final adverse determination if the enrollee has a medical condition where the time frame for completion of a standard external review would seriously jeopardize the enrollee's ability to gain maximum functioning, or would subject the enrollee to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the adverse determination; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) A final adverse determination if the final adverse determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care service for which the enrollee received emergency services; provided that the enrollee has not been discharged from a facility for health care services related to the emergency services.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Upon receipt of a request for an expedited external review, the commissioner shall immediately send a copy of the request to the health carrier.

The health carrier may elect to proceed with its internal review process even though the request is determined by the commissioner to be eligible for expedited external review; provided that the internal review process shall not delay or terminate an expedited external review unless the health carrier decides to reverse its adverse determination and provide coverage or payment for the health care service that is the subject of the adverse determination.
