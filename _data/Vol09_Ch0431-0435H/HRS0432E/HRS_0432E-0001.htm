<p class="XNotes"> As chapter 432D does not cover the field of managed care regulation and because this section, ยง432D-2,<b> </b>and article 431:10A can be read together and there is no explicit language or policy reason not to give each statute effect, chapter 432D does not repeal chapter 432E by implication. 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621 (2012).</p>
