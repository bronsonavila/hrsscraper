<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Amounts assessed against insurers for payment into the insurance regulation fund under this section was a regulatory fee and not an unconstitutional tax where (1) the charges were assessed by the commissioner; (2) the assessments were placed into a special fund intended to reimburse the division for insurance industry regulating costs; and (3) moneys from the fund to pay for services provided by the departments of commerce and consumer affairs and budget and finance, and to buttress the division's reserve fund were "used for the regulation or benefit of the parties upon whom the assessment was imposed". 120 H. 51, 201 P.3d 564 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where insurance commissioner imposed a substantial portion of the administrative cost of operating the insurance division and its supporting offices and divisions upon insurers pursuant to this section, and the insurance division's regulatory costs were necessitated by the business of insurers, this section did not violate the equal protection clauses of the Hawaii or U.S. Constitutions. 120 H. 51, 201 P.3d 564 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where regulatory fees assessed against insurers by the insurance commissioner, an officer of the executive branch, for payment into the insurance regulation fund under this section were transferred by the legislature via transfer bills from the insurance division into the general fund, and the regulatory fees became available for general purposes as if derived from general tax revenues, the transfers violated the separation of powers doctrine under the Hawaii constitution, article VIII, §3, and §26-10(b). 120 H. 51, 201 P.3d 564 (2008).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Amounts assessed by the state insurance division against insurers for payment into the insurance regulation fund under this section did not violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions where the regulatory fees were rationally related to the statutory objective of defraying any administrative costs and costs incurred by supporting offices and divisions. 117 H. 454 (App.), 184 P.3d 769 (2008).</p>
