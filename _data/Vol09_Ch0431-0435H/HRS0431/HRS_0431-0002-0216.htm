<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The assessments shall be used to defray any administrative costs, including personnel costs, associated with the programs of the division, and costs incurred by supporting offices and divisions. Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, the commissioner may use the moneys from assessments to employ or retain, by contract or otherwise, without regard to chapter 76, hearings officers, attorneys, investigators, accountants, examiners, and other necessary professional, technical, administrative, and support personnel to implement and carry out the purposes of title 24 as it relates to accident and health or sickness insurance; provided that any position, except any attorney position, that was subject to chapter 76 prior to July 1, 1999, shall remain subject to chapter 76.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The commissioner may suspend any assessment made against any mutual benefit society under article 1 of chapter 432, health maintenance organization under chapter 432D, and any other entity offering or providing health benefits or services under the regulation of the commissioner if the commissioner determines that the entity may reach insolvency or other financial difficulty if the assessment is made against the entity.
