The special purpose financial captive insurance company shall be afforded the opportunity for a hearing pursuant to chapter 91.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) and section 91-9.5, the commissioner may cause the immediate suspension or restriction of the special purpose financial captive insurance company's certificate of authority, subject to timely subsequent notice and opportunity for a hearing, upon the commissioner's determination that the failure to take an action may result in the material deterioration of the financial condition or soundness of the special purpose financial captive insurance company, and that for the protection of the public from the possible consequences of practices, the special purpose financial captive insurance company's certificate of authority should be immediately suspended or restricted.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The commissioner may order the summary suspension of the certificate of authority for a period not to exceed the later of thirty days or, if a hearing is requested by the special purpose financial captive insurance company pursuant to chapter 91, the conclusion of the hearing. Any attempt by the special purpose financial captive insurance company to continue its operations while its certificate of authority has been summarily suspended shall be sufficient to warrant a permanent revocation of the certificate of authority and shall subject the special purpose financial captive insurance company to all penalties prescribed by this article, or any rule or order issued by the commissioner.</p>
