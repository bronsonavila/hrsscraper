<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Provision excluding welfare recipients from receiving medical coverage under no-fault automobile insurance policies violated medicaid provision of Social Security Act. 928 F.2d 898.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Vehicle was "uninsured" where vehicle operator's liability insurance did not cover injured passenger and vehicle owner had no insurance. 807 F. Supp. 98.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Households of plaintiff and spouse were separate and not a family unit for purposes of paragraph (11). 812 F. Supp. 1083.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where named insured is a corporation, son of officer/shareholder of corporation is not an "insured" under paragraph (11). 816 F. Supp. 633.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Insurer not obligated to defend or indemnify insured, or otherwise pay any sums to defendants; defendant's shooting was no accident from insured's viewpoint or perspective. 834 F. Supp. 329.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where insurer contended that plaintiff lacked standing to bring bad faith claim because plaintiff, a covered person under taxicab owner's insurance contract, was not defined as an insured in no-fault insurance statute, plaintiff, a third party beneficiary of taxicab owner's policy, was essentially an insured and to treat plaintiff otherwise made no sense. 947 F. Supp. 429.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Because police officer's injuries did not arise out of the use of a vehicle, there was no uninsured motorist coverage under either of the two policies at issue. Officer had argued that officer's injuries arose out of three "uses" of automobiles, e.g., officer was "using" a vehicle by trying to "secure" it. 187 F. Supp. 2d 1231.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court erred in concluding that insurance company did not owe defendant duty to defend or indemnify on basis that shooting did not arise out of a motor vehicle "accident". 74 H. 620, 851 P.2d 321.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Car rental company not an "insurer" as defined under paragraph (5). 82 H. 351, 922 P.2d 964.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where self-insurer rent-a-car company not an "insurer" as defined in this section, court erred in granting attorney's fees and costs under §431:10-242. 85 H. 243, 942 P.2d 507.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Insofar as Hawaii administrative rule §16-23-11 conflicted with paragraph (10)(B) (1987) by limiting survivors' benefits to $15,000 despite the presence of expanded no-fault coverage, §16-23-11 was void as a matter of law. 88 H. 344, 966 P.2d 1070.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Facts and circumstances of the case demonstrated that plaintiff was temporarily absent from father's home while attending college in Hawaii at the time of the accident; thus, trial court did not err in concluding that plaintiff was a resident of plaintiff's father's, the named insured's household in California and therefore a covered person under the insurance policy for underinsured motorist benefits. 107 H. 192, 111 P.3d 601 (2005).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits under Hawaii motor vehicle insurance law where an "uninsured motor vehicle" as defined in this section was not involved in causing plaintiff's injuries. 81 H. 110 (App.), 912 P.2d 607.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Pursuant to §431:10C-304(1)(B) (1987) and paragraph (10)(B) (1987), upon the death of an insured, the insurer is obligated to provide the insured's survivor a survivor's loss benefit of up to either (1) $15,000 where the insured has purchased only the basic no-fault coverage, or (2) the expanded limits of no-fault benefits where the insured has contracted for it under an optional additional coverage. 88 H. 345 (App.), 966 P.2d 1071.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under paragraph (10)(A) (1993), no-fault benefits are expenses which are appropriate, reasonable and necessarily incurred and are not restricted to treatment characterized as "curative" as opposed to "palliative". 90 H. 213 (App.), 978 P.2d 179.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As motorcycles are excluded from the definition of "motor vehicle" under this section, appellant's accident with a motorcycle was not a "motor vehicle accident" under the definition set forth in this section; appellant was thus not entitled to no-fault benefits under §431:10C-303(a) (1993). 91 H. 299 (App.), 983 P.2d 200.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Other than the named insured, the only persons residing in the same household with a named insured who qualify as "insureds" under this section are "a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary or other relative of a named insured" and "a minor in the custody of a named insured or of a relative residing in the same household with a named insured"; as plaintiff was not a descendant of an ancestor common with the insureds, nor adopted by or married to a daughter or other relative of them, plaintiff was not a "relative" of and could not qualify as an "insured" on the sole basis that plaintiff resided in the same household with the insureds. 113 H. 196 (App.), 150 P.3d 845 (2007).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Construing the language of §431:10C-301 and this section governing uninsured motorist (UM) and underinsured motorist (UIM) insurance according to their plain and commonly understood meaning and in pari materia with §§663-10.9 and 663-11, UM and UIM policies must provide coverage for all damages which an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle, which necessarily encompasses damages for which the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle is jointly and severally liable pursuant to §§663-10.9 and 663-11. 120 H. 329 (App.), 205 P.3d 594 (2009).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> To obtain underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage in Hawaii, the liability for damages must exceed the total amount of bodily injury liability limits applicable at the time of the loss and the policy limits for uninsured motorist coverage and payments or settlements are not part of that analysis; thus, trial court correctly determined that the joint and several "damages imposed by law" against the driver exceeded the cumulative limits of driver's bodily injury policies, driver met the statutory definition of an UIM, and the insurer therefore was obligated to pay victim UIM benefits to compensate victim for the difference. 120 H. 329 (App.), 205 P.3d 594 (2009).</p>
