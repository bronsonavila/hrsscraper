<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง431:10A-401 Purpose.</b> It is the purpose of this part to provide a means of more adequately meeting the needs of persons who are sixty-five years of age or older and their spouses for insurance coverage against financial loss from accident or disease through the combined resources and experience of a number of insurers; to make possible the fullest extension of such coverage by encouraging insurers to combine their resources and experience and to exercise their collective efforts in the development and offering of policies of such insurance to all such applicants at costs lower than those generally available through individual insurers; and to regulate the joint activities herein authorized in accordance with the intent of Congress as expressed in the Act of Congress of March 9, 1945 (Public Law 15, 79th Congress), as amended.
