<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Persons who are owners of or certificate holders under such policies or contracts, except structured settlement annuities, and who:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) Are residents of this State; or</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) Are not residents; provided that:</p>
<p class="iClause"> (i) The insurer that issued the policies or contracts is domiciled in this State;</p>
<p class="iClause"> (ii) The state in which the persons reside has associations similar to the association created by this part; and</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) For structured settlement annuities specified in subsection (b), paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not apply, and this part, except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection, shall provide coverage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement annuity, or beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased, if the payee:</p>

In determining the application of the provisions of this paragraph in situations where a person could be covered by the association of more than one state, whether as an owner, payee, beneficiary, or assignee, this part shall be construed in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage by only one association.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (b)(1) This part shall provide coverage to the persons specified in subsection (a) for direct, nongroup life, accident and health or sickness, or annuity policies or contracts, for certificates under direct group life, accident and health or sickness, or annuity policies or contracts, and for supplemental contracts to any of these, in each case issued by member insurers except as limited by this part.

If a policy's or contract's interest or changes in value are credited less frequently than annually, then for purposes of determining the values that have been credited and are not subject to forfeiture under section 431:16-403(b)(2)(L), the interest or change in value determined by using the procedures defined in the policy or contract shall be credited as if the contractual date of crediting interest or changing values was the date of impairment or insolvency and shall not be subject to forfeiture; or</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (L) Any policy or contract providing any hospital, medical, prescription drug, or other health care benefits pursuant to part C or part D of subchapter XVIII, chapter 7, title 42 of the United States Code, commonly known as medicare part C and D, or any regulations adopted pursuant thereto.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The benefits for which the association may become liable shall in no event exceed the lesser of:</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) The limitations set forth in this section are limitations on the benefits for which the association is obligated before taking into account its subrogation and assignment rights or the extent to which those benefits could be provided out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies. The costs of the association's obligations under this part may be met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed to the association pursuant to its subrogation and assignment rights.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) In performing its obligations to provide coverage under section 431:16-208, the association shall not be required to guarantee, assume, reinsure, or perform, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reinsured, or performed, the contractual obligations of the insolvent or impaired insurer under a covered policy or contract that do not materially affect the economic values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.
