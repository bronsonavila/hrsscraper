<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The liquidator may permit a claimant making a late filing to share in distributions, whether past or future, as if the claimant were not late, to the extent that any such payment will not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation, under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The existence of the claim was not known to the claimant and that the claimant filed such claim as promptly as reasonably possible after learning of it;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) A transfer to a creditor was avoided under section 431:15-315 through section 431:15-317, or was voluntarily surrendered under section 431:15-318, and that the filing satisfies the conditions of section 431:15-318; and</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The liquidator may consider any claim filed late which is not covered by subsection (b), and permit it to receive distributions which are subsequently declared on any claims of the same or lower priority if the payment does not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation. The late filing claimant shall receive, at each distribution, the same percentage of the amount allowed on the claimant's claim as is then being paid to claimants of any lower priority. This shall continue until the claimant's claim has been paid in full.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Claims by guaranty funds or associations, or foreign guaranty funds or associations shall be filed periodically by the funds or associations pursuant to rules adopted by the commissioner. These claims shall share in all subsequently declared distributions as if they were not late. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]</p>
