<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) An insurer shall provide notice of a pending premium rate schedule increase, including an exceptional increase, to the commissioner at least thirty days prior to the notice to the policyholders and shall include:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Information required by section 431:10H-221;</p>

If the commissioner determines, as provided in paragraph (4) of the definition of "exceptional increase" in section 431:10H-104, that offsets may exist, the insurer shall use appropriate net projected experience;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) Disclosure of how reserves have been incorporated in this rate increase whenever the rate increase will trigger a contingent benefit upon lapse;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) Disclosure of the analysis performed to determine why a rate adjustment is necessary, which pricing assumptions were not realized and why, and what other actions taken by the company have been relied on by the actuary;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (D) A statement that policy design, underwriting, and claims adjudication practices have been taken into consideration; and</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Sufficient information for the review of the premium rate schedule increase by the commissioner.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) All premium rate schedule increases shall be determined in accordance with the following requirements:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Exceptional increases shall provide that seventy per cent of the present value of projected additional premiums from the exceptional increase shall be returned to policyholders in benefits;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Premium rate schedule increases shall be calculated so that the sum of the accumulated value of incurred claims, without the inclusion of active life reserves, and the present value of future projected incurred claims, without the inclusion of active life reserves, will not be less than the sum of the following:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The accumulated value of the initial earned premium times fifty-eight per cent;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) Eighty-five per cent of the accumulated value of prior premium rate schedule increases on an earned basis;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) The present value of future projected initial earned premiums times fifty-eight per cent; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (D) Eighty-five per cent of the present value of future projected premiums not in subparagraph (C) on an earned basis;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) If a policy form has both exceptional and other increases, the values in paragraph (2)(B) and (D) shall also include seventy per cent for exceptional rate increase amounts; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) All present and accumulated values used to determine rate increases shall use the maximum valuation interest rate for contract reserves, as applicable, as specified in sections 431:5-303 and 431:5-307. The actuary shall disclose as part of the actuarial memorandum the use of any appropriate averages.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) For each rate increase that is implemented, the insurer shall file for review by the commissioner updated projections, as provided in subsection (b)(3)(A), annually for the next three years, and include a comparison of actual results to projected values. The commissioner may extend the period to greater than three years if actual results are not consistent with projected values from prior projections. For group insurance policies that meet the conditions in subsection (k), the projections required by this subsection shall be provided to the policyholder in lieu of filing with the commissioner.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) If any premium rate in the revised premium rate schedule is greater than two hundred per cent of the comparable rate in the initial premium schedule, lifetime projections, as provided in subsection (b)(3)(A), shall be filed for review by the commissioner every five years following the end of the required period in subsection (d). For group insurance policies that meet the conditions in subsection (k), the projections required by this subsection shall be provided to the policyholder in lieu of filing with the commissioner.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) If the commissioner has determined that the actual experience following a rate increase does not adequately match the projected experience and that the current projections under moderately adverse conditions demonstrate that incurred claims will not exceed proportions of premiums specified in subsection (c), the commissioner may require the insurer to implement any of the following:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Premium rate schedule adjustments; or </p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Other measures to reduce the difference between the projected and actual experience. </p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> In determining whether the actual experience adequately matches the projected experience, consideration should be given to subsection (b)(3)(E), if applicable.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) If the majority of the policies or certificates to which the increase is applicable are eligible for the contingent benefit upon lapse, the insurer shall file:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) A plan, subject to the commissioner's approval, for improved administration or claims processing designed to eliminate the potential for further deterioration of the policy form requiring further premium rate schedule increases, or both, or to demonstrate that appropriate administration and claims processing have been implemented or are in effect; otherwise the commissioner may impose the condition in subsection (h); and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The original anticipated lifetime loss ratio and the premium rate schedule increase that would have been calculated according to subsection (c), had the greater of the original anticipated lifetime loss ratio or fifty-eight per cent been used in the calculations described in subsection (c)(2)(A) and (C).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (h) For a rate increase filing that meets the following criteria, the commissioner shall review, for all policies included in the filing, the projected lapse rates and past lapse rates during the twelve months following each increase to determine if significant adverse lapsing has occurred or is anticipated:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The rate increase is not the first rate increase requested for the specific policy form or forms;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The rate increase is not an exceptional increase; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The majority of the policies or certificates to which the increase is applicable are eligible for the contingent benefit upon lapse.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> If significant adverse lapsing has occurred, is anticipated in the filing, or is evidenced in the actual results as presented in the updated projections provided by the insurer following the requested rate increase, the commissioner may determine that a rate spiral exists. Following the determination that a rate spiral exists, the commissioner may require the insurer to offer, without underwriting, to all in force insureds, subject to the rate increase, the option to replace existing coverage with one or more reasonably comparable products being offered by the insurer or its affiliates; provided that the offer shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, be based on actuarially sound principles but not on attained age, and provide that maximum benefits under any new policy accepted by an insured shall be reduced by comparable benefits already paid under the existing policy.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The insurer shall maintain the experience of all the replacement insureds separate from the experience of insureds originally issued the policy forms. In the event of a request for a rate increase on the policy form, the rate increase shall be limited to the lesser of the maximum rate increase determined based on the combined experience or the maximum rate increase determined based only on the experience of the insureds originally issued the form plus ten per cent.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (i) If the commissioner determines that the insurer has exhibited a persistent practice of filing inadequate initial premium rates for long-term care insurance, the commissioner, in addition to subsection (h), may prohibit the insurer from either of the following:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Filing and marketing comparable coverage for a period of up to five years; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Offering all other similar coverages and limiting marketing of new applications to the products subject to recent premium rate schedule increases.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (j) Subsections (a) to (i) shall not apply to policies for which the long-term care benefits provided by the policy are incidental, as defined in section 431:10H-104, if the policy complies with all of the following provisions:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The interest credited internally to determine cash value accumulations, including long-term care, if any, are guaranteed not to be less than the minimum guaranteed interest rate for cash value accumulations without long-term care set forth in the policy;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The portion of the policy that provides insurance benefits, other than long-term care coverage, meets the nonforfeiture requirements as applicable in any of the following:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) Section 431:10D-104; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) Section 431:10D-107;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The policy meets the disclosure requirements of sections 431:10H-113 and 431:10H-114;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) The portion of the policy that provides insurance benefits, other than long-term care coverage, meets the requirements as applicable in the following:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) Policy illustrations as required by part IV of article 10D; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) Disclosure requirements, as applicable, in article [10D]; and</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (F) The estimated average annual premium per policy and the average issue age;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (G) A statement as to whether underwriting is performed at the time of application.

Concerning a group policy, the statement shall indicate whether the enrollee or any dependent will be underwritten and when that underwriting occurs; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (H) A description of the effect of the long-term care policy provision on the required premiums, nonforfeiture values, and reserves on the underlying insurance policy, both for active lives and those in long-term care claim status.</p>
