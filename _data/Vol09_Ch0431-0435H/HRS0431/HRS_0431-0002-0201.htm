<p class="XNotes"> The division will be responsible for enforcement of health insurance provisions of the reciprocal beneficiaries act [L 1997, c 383], because those provisions are placed within the insurance code and, therefore, are within the commissioner's enforcement responsibility under subsection (b); those provisions can only be enforced against insurers, not employers. Att. Gen. Op. 97-10.</p>
