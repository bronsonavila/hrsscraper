<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§431:15-301 Grounds for rehabilitation.</b> (a) The commissioner may apply by petition to the circuit court of the first judicial circuit for an order authorizing the commissioner to rehabilitate a domestic insurer or an alien insurer domiciled in this State, on any one or more of the following grounds whenever the commissioner reasonably believes that the insurer may be successfully rehabilitated without substantial increase in the risk of loss to the insurer's policyholders, creditors, or to the public:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The insurer is insolvent;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The insurer is in such condition that the further transaction of business would be hazardous, financially, to its policyholders, creditors or the public;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) There is reasonable cause to believe that there has been embezzlement from the insurer, wrongful sequestration or diversion of the insurer's assets, forgery or fraud affecting the insurer, or other illegal conduct in, by, or with respect to the insurer that if established would endanger assets in an amount threatening the solvency of the insurer;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) The insurer has failed to remove any person who in fact has executive authority in the insurer, whether an officer, manager, general agent, employee, or other person, if the person has been found after notice and hearing by the commissioner to be dishonest or untrustworthy in a way affecting the insurer's business;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Control of the insurer, whether by stock ownership or otherwise, and whether direct or indirect, is in a person or persons found after notice and hearing to be untrustworthy;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) Any person who in fact has executive authority in the insurer, whether an officer, manager, general agent, director or trustee, employee, or other person, has refused to be examined under oath by the commissioner concerning its affairs, whether in this State or elsewhere, and after reasonable notice of the fact the insurer has failed promptly and effectively to terminate the employment and status of the person and all such person's influence on management;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) After demand by the commissioner under article 2 or under this article, the insurer has failed to promptly make available for examination any of its own property, books, accounts, documents, or other records, or those of any subsidiary or related company within the control of the insurer, or those of any person having executive authority in the insurer so far as they pertain to the insurer;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (8) Without first obtaining the written consent of the commissioner, the insurer has transferred, or attempted to transfer, in a manner contrary to article 11 or section 431:3-215, substantially its entire property or business, or has entered into any transaction the effect of which is to merge, consolidate or reinsure substantially its entire property or business in or with the property or business of any other person;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (9) The insurer or its property has been or is the subject of an application for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, or sequestrator, or similar fiduciary of the insurer or its property, otherwise than as authorized under the insurance laws of this State, and such appointment has been made or is imminent, and such appointment might oust the courts of this State of jurisdiction or might prejudice orderly delinquency proceedings under this article;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (10) Within the previous four years the insurer has wilfully violated its charter or articles of incorporation, its bylaws, any insurance law of this State, or any valid order of the commissioner under section 431:15-201;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (11) The insurer has failed to pay within sixty days after due date any obligation to any state or any subdivision thereof or any judgment entered in any state, if the court in which such judgment was entered had jurisdiction over such subject matter, except that such nonpayment shall not be a ground until sixty days after any good faith effort by the insurer to contest the obligation has been terminated, whether it is before the commissioner or in the courts, or the insurer has established general business practices which attempt to compromise or renegotiate previously agreed settlements with its creditors on the ground that it is financially unable to pay its obligations in full;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (12) The insurer has failed to file its annual report or other financial report required by statute within the time allowed by law and, after written demand by the commissioner, has failed to give an adequate explanation immediately; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (13) The board of directors or the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, or a majority of those individuals entitled to the control of those entities request or consent to rehabilitation under this article.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Nothing herein contained shall be construed as creating or enlarging any of the duties of the guaranty associations as may be set forth in article 16. [L 1987, c 347, pt of §2]</p>
