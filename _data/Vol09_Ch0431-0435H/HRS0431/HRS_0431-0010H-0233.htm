<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> ยง431:10H-233 </b><b>Nonforfeiture benefit requirement</b>. (a) This section does not apply to life insurance policies containing accelerated long-term care benefits.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) To comply with the requirement to offer a nonforfeiture benefit pursuant to section 431:10H-116, the following shall be met:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) A policy or certificate offered with nonforfeiture benefits shall have coverage elements, eligibility, benefit triggers, and benefit length that are the same as coverage to be issued without nonforfeiture benefits. The nonforfeiture benefit included in the offer shall be the benefit described in subsection (j); and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The offer shall be in writing if the nonforfeiture benefit is not otherwise described in the outline of coverage or other materials given to the prospective policyholder.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If the offer required to be made under section 431:10H-116 is rejected, the insurer shall provide the contingent benefit upon lapse described in this section. Even if this offer is accepted for a policy with a fixed or limited premium paying period, the contingent benefit on lapse in subsection (g) shall still apply.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) After rejection of the offer required under section 431:10H-116, for individual and group policies without nonforfeiture benefits issued after June 30, 2000, the insurer shall provide a contingent benefit upon lapse.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) If a group policyholder elects to make the nonforfeiture benefit an option to the certificate holder, a certificate shall provide either the nonforfeiture benefit or the contingent benefit upon lapse.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) The contingent benefit on lapse shall be triggered every time an insurer increases the premium rates to a level which results in a cumulative increase of the annual premium equal to or exceeding the percentage of the insured's initial annual premium set forth in the table below based on the insured's issue age, and the policy or certificate lapses within one hundred twenty days of the due date of the premium so increased. Unless otherwise required, policyholders and certificate holders shall be notified at least thirty days prior to the due date of the premium reflecting the rate increase.</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Offer to reduce policy benefits provided by the current coverage without the requirement of additional underwriting so that required premium payments are not increased;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) For purposes of this subsection, the nonforfeiture benefit shall be of a shortened benefit period providing paid-up long-term care insurance coverage after lapse. The same benefits (amounts and frequency in effect at the time of lapse but not increased thereafter) shall be payable for a qualifying claim, but the lifetime maximum dollars or days of benefits shall be determined as provided in paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The standard nonforfeiture credit shall be equal to one hundred per cent of the sum of all premiums paid, including the premiums paid prior to any changes in benefits. The insurer may offer additional shortened benefit period options, as long as the benefits for each duration equal or exceed the standard forfeiture credit for that duration. However, the minimum nonforfeiture credit shall not be less than thirty times the daily nursing home benefit at the time of lapse. In either event, the calculation of the nonforfeiture credit is subject to the limitation of subsection (k);</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) The end of the second year following the date the policy or certificate is no longer subject to attained age rating; and</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (o) To determine whether contingent nonforfeiture upon lapse provisions are triggered under subsection (f) or (g), a replacing insurer that purchased or otherwise assumed a block or blocks of long-term care insurance policies from another insurer shall calculate the percentage increase based on the initial annual premium paid by the insured when the policy was first purchased from the original insurer.</p>
