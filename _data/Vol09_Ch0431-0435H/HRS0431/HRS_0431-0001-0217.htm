<p class="XNotes"> Subsection (a) required that commercial general liability umbrella policies in question, issued by plaintiff insurers in 2007, be interpreted under the law as it existed in 2007; even if this statute ostensibly nullified the Hawaii intermediate court of appeals' decision in Group Builders by "restoring" pre-Group Builders law, the statute did not purport to nullify any decision preceding Group Builders; thus, the policies in issue continued to fall under the Ninth Circuit's 2004 analysis in Burlington. 870 F. Supp. 2d 1015 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Pursuant to subsection (a), the court could not construe the meaning of the term "occurrence" based on the holding in Group Builders because the case was decided on May 19, 2010, and was not in existence when plaintiff issued the general liability insurance policies, the most recent of which took effect on January 18, 2010. The operative case law was that which existed at the time plaintiff issued the first policy, which took effect on November 11, 2002. 891 F. Supp. 2d 1179 (2012).</p>
