<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง431:10H-205] Continuation or conversion.</b> (a) Group long-term care insurance issued in this State beginning July 1, 2000, shall provide covered individuals with a basis for continuation or conversion of coverage.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) For purposes of this section, "a basis for continuation of coverage" means a policy provision that maintains coverage under the existing group policy when the coverage would otherwise terminate and which is subject only to the continued timely payment of premium when due. Group policies that restrict provision of benefits and services to, or contain incentives to use certain providers or facilities may provide continuation benefits that are substantially equivalent to the benefits of the existing group policy. The commissioner shall make a determination as to the substantial equivalency of benefits, and in doing so, shall take into consideration the differences between managed care and non-managed care plans, including but not limited to, provider system arrangements, service availability, benefit levels, and administrative complexity.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) For purposes of this section, "a basis for conversion of coverage" means a policy provision that entitles an individual, whose coverage under the group policy would otherwise terminate or has been terminated for any reason including discontinuance of the group policy in its entirety or with respect to an insured class, and who has been continuously insured under the group policy or any group policy that it replaced for at least six months immediately prior to termination shall be entitled to the issuance of a converted policy by the insurer under whose group policy the individual is covered, without evidence of insurability.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) For purposes of this section, "converted policy" means an individual policy of long-term care insurance providing benefits identical to or benefits determined by the commissioner to be substantially equivalent to or in excess of those provided under the group policy from which conversion is made. Where the group policy from which conversion is made restricts provision of benefits and services to, or contains incentives to use certain providers or facilities, the commissioner, in making a determination as to substantial equivalency of benefits, shall take into consideration the differences between managed care and non-managed care plans, including but not limited to, provider system arrangements, service availability, benefit levels, and administrative complexity.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Written application for the converted policy shall be made and the first premium, if any, shall be paid as directed by the insurer no later than thirty-one days after termination of coverage under the group policy. The converted policy shall be issued effective on the day following the termination of coverage under the group policy, and shall be renewable annually.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) Unless the group policy from which conversion is made replaced previous group policy coverage, the premium for the converted policy shall be calculated on the basis of the insured's age at inception of coverage under the group policy from which conversion is made. Where the group policy from which conversion is made replaced a previous group coverage, the premium for the converted policy shall be calculated on the basis of the insured's age at inception of coverage under the group policy replaced.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) Continuation of coverage or issuance of a converted policy shall be mandatory, except where:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Termination of group coverage resulted from an individual's failure to make any required payment of premium or contribution when due; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The terminating coverage is replaced not later than thirty-one days after termination by another group coverage effective on the day following the termination of coverage:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) Providing benefits or benefits determined by the commissioner to be identical substantially equivalent to or in excess of those provided by the terminating coverage; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) The premium for which is calculated in a manner consistent with the requirements of subsection (f).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a converted policy issued to an individual who at the time of conversion is covered by another long-term care insurance policy that provides benefits on the basis of incurred expenses, may contain a provision that results in a reduction of benefits payable if the benefits provided under the additional coverage, together with the full benefits provided by the converted policy, would result in payment of more than one hundred per cent of incurred expenses. The provision shall only be included in the converted policy if the converted policy also provides for a premium decrease or refund which reflects the reduction in benefits payable.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (i) The converted policy may provide that the benefits payable under the converted policy, together with the benefits payable under the group policy from which conversion is made, shall not exceed those that would have been payable had the individual's coverage under the group policy remained in force and effect. </p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an insured individual whose eligibility for group long-term care coverage is based upon the individual's relationship to another person shall be entitled to continuation of coverage under the group policy upon termination of the qualifying relationship by death or dissolution of marriage or reciprocal beneficiary relationship.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (k) For purposes of this section "managed care plan" is a health care or assisted living arrangement designed to coordinate patient care or control costs through utilization review, case management, or use of specific provider networks. [L 1999, c 93, pt of ยง2]</p>
