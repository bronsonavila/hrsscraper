<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§431:21-119 Issuance of new policies; removal of moratorium.</b> If residential property insurance is unavailable, as determined by the commissioner, due to a moratorium on the issuance of policies on property situated in lava zones where the mayor of the county of Hawaii has issued a proclamation declaring a state of emergency exists due to the threat of imminent disaster from a lava flow, the association shall remove its moratorium. Upon the moratorium's removal, the association shall offer new policies and may provide a waiting period of no longer than six months for the policy coverage to take effect; provided that the residential property in the lava zone does not have current insurance.
