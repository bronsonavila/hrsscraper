<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) For the purposes of this code, the transacting of life insurance includes the granting of annuities and endowment benefits, except for annuities that are provided under a charitable gift annuity agreement with a donor and issued by a nonprofit educational foundation or a nonprofit organization that has met the requirements of paragraphs (1) to (4).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> A nonprofit educational foundation or nonprofit organization issuing charitable gift annuities shall:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Meet the following requirements:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The foundation or organization shall have conducted business in the form of program services or fundraising activities in the State continuously for at least ten years;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) The foundation or organization shall maintain a net worth in the State of not less than $200,000 in cash, cash equivalents, or publicly traded securities, exclusive of the assets funding any annuity; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) The foundation or organization shall have filed an annual statement that certifies compliance with this subsection, on forms that may be prescribed by the department of the attorney general.
