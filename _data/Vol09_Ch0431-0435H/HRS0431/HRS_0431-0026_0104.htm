<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Every contract between a health carrier and a participating provider shall contain the following hold harmless statement, specifying protection for covered persons, or a substantially similar statement:</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="margin-left:.5in">"Provider agrees that in no event, including but not limited to nonpayment by the health carrier or intermediary, insolvency of the health carrier or intermediary, or breach of this agreement, shall the provider bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation, remuneration, or reimbursement from, or have any recourse against a covered person or a person other than the health carrier or intermediary, as applicable, acting on behalf of the covered person for services provided pursuant to this agreement. This agreement does not prohibit the provider from collecting coinsurance, deductibles, or copayments, as specifically provided in the evidence of coverage, or fees for uncovered services delivered on a fee-for-service basis to covered persons; provided that a provider shall not bill or collect from a covered person or a person acting on behalf of a covered person any charges for non-covered services or services that do not meet the criteria in section 432E-1.4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, unless an agreement of financial responsibility specific to the service is signed by the covered person or a person acting on behalf of the covered person and is obtained prior to the time services are rendered. This agreement does not prohibit a provider, except for a health care professional who is employed full-time on the staff of a health carrier and has agreed to provide services exclusively to that health carrier's covered persons and no others, and a covered person from agreeing to continue services solely at the expense of the covered person; provided that the provider has clearly informed the covered person that the health carrier may not cover or continue to cover a specific service or services. Except as provided herein, this agreement does not prohibit the provider from pursuing any available legal remedy."</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Every contract between a health carrier and a participating provider shall provide that in the event of a health carrier or intermediary insolvency or other cessation of operations, the provider's obligation to deliver covered services to covered persons without balance billing shall continue until the earlier of:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The termination of the covered person's coverage under the network plan, including any extension of coverage provided under the contract terms or applicable state or federal law for covered persons who are in an active course of treatment or totally disabled; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The date the contract between the carrier and the provider, including any required extension for covered persons in an active course of treatment, would have terminated if the carrier or intermediary had remained in operation.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Contract provisions required by subsections (b) and (c) shall be construed in favor of the covered person, shall survive the termination of the contract regardless of the reason for termination, including the insolvency of the health carrier, and shall supersede any oral or written contrary agreement between a provider and a covered person or the representative of a covered person if the contrary agreement is inconsistent with the hold harmless and continuation-of-covered services requirements under subsections (b) and (c).</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Selection criteria shall not be established in a manner:</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) That would exclude providers because the providers treat or specialize in treating populations presenting a risk of higher than average claims, losses, or health care services utilization; or</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) That would discriminate with respect to participation under the health benefit plan against any provider who is acting within the scope of the provider's license or certification under applicable state law or regulations; provided that this subparagraph shall not be construed to require a health carrier to contract with any provider who is willing to abide by the terms and conditions for participation established by the carrier; </p>
