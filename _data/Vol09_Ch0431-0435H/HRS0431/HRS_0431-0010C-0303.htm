<p class="XNotes"> Right to no-fault benefits is not absolute. 73 H. 552, 836 P.2d 1074.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As motorcycles are excluded from the definition of "motor vehicle" under §431:10C-103, appellant's accident with a motorcycle was not a "motor vehicle accident" under the definition set forth in §431:10C-103; appellant was thus not entitled to no-fault benefits under subsection (a) (1993). 91 H. 299 (App.), 983 P.2d 200.</p>
