As used in this subsection, "issue year basis" means a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and "change in fund basis" means a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) The reference interest rate referred to in paragraph (2) shall be defined as follows:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) For life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year preceding the year of issue, of the monthly average of composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B), with guarantee duration in excess of ten years, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (E) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (F) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B), the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) In the event that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or in the event that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners determines that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and approved by rules adopted by the commissioner may be substituted.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (h)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (i), (l), and (n), reserves, according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for a policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits such that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subparagraph (A) over subparagraph (B) as follows:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due; provided that the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen-year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age of issue of the policy; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) A net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) For a life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year, and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess, and that provides an endowment benefit, a cash surrender value, or a combination thereof, in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve, according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date, defined herein as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium, except as otherwise provided in subsection (l), shall be the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated pursuant to this paragraph and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described, but with:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The value defined in paragraph (1) being reduced by fifteen per cent of the amount of the excess first year premium;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) All present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) The policy being assumed to mature on that date as an endowment; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (D) The cash surrender value provided on that date being considered as an endowment benefit.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> In making the above comparison, the mortality and interest bases stated in subsections (e) and (g) shall be used; and</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended;</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (D) All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (i) This subsection shall apply to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer (including a partnership or sole proprietorship) or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as now or hereafter amended.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Reserves according to the commissioner's annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability income and accidental death benefits in the contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided for by the contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of the contract, that become payable prior to the end of the respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate, or rates, specified in the contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of the contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (j) In no event shall a company's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability income and accidental death benefits, issued on or after January 1, 1956, be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subsections (h), (i), (l), and (m), and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for those policies. In no event shall the aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts, and benefits be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsections (c) and (d).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (k) With regard to optional reserve calculation:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Reserves for policies and contracts issued prior to January 1, 1956, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to that date;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits established by the commissioner, issued on or after January 1, 1956, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for the category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided herein, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided in the policies or contracts; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) A company, which adopts at any time a standard valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided under this section, may adopt a lower standard of valuation with the approval of the commissioner, but not lower than the minimum provided herein; provided that for the purposes of this section, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsections (c) and (d) shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (l) If in any contract year the gross premium charged by a company on a policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for the policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for the policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract, but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this subsection are those standards stated in subsections (e) and (g). For a life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and that provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value, or a combination thereof, in an amount greater than the excess premium, this subsection shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for the policy were the method described in subsection (h), ignoring subsection (h)(2). The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection (h), including subsection (h)(2) and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (m) In the case of any plan of life insurance that provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance or annuity that is of such a nature that the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (h), (i), and (l), the reserves that are held under the plan shall:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Be computed by a method that is consistent with the principles of this section, as determined by rules adopted by the commissioner.</p>
