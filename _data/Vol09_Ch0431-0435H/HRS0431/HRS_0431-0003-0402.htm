<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) An excess of capital, or net worth, over the amount produced by the risk-based capital requirements contained in this part and the formulas, schedules, and instructions referenced in this part is desirable in the business of insurance. Accordingly, insurers shall seek to maintain capital above the risk-based capital levels required by this part. Additional capital is used and useful in the business of insurance and helps to secure an insurer against various risks inherent in or affecting the business of insurance and not accounted for or only partially measured by the risk-based capital requirements contained in this part.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) If a domestic insurer files a risk-based capital report which, in the judgment of the commissioner, is inaccurate, then the commissioner shall adjust the risk-based capital report to correct the inaccuracy and shall notify the insurer of the adjustment. The notice shall contain a statement of the reason for the adjustment. A risk-based capital report adjusted pursuant to this subsection is referred to as an adjusted risk-based capital report.
