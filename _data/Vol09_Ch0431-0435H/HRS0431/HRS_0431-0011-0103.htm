In calculating the amount of the investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries shall be excluded, and there shall be included:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) Total net moneys or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities, and</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset; and</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Whether any investment pursuant to subsection (b) meets the applicable requirements thereof is to be determined before the investment is made, by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment therein made pursuant to this section within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further time as the commissioner may prescribe, unless at any time after the investment shall have been made, the investment shall have met the requirements for investment under any other section of this code, and the insurer has notified the commissioner thereof.
