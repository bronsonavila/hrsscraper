A producer, premium finance company, or any other person shall have no obligation to pay an uncollected, unpaid, unearned premium to the liquidator. The liquidator shall also have the right to recover from the person any part of an unearned premium that represents commission actually paid or credited to the person. Credits or setoffs or both shall not be allowed to a producer or premium finance company for any amounts advanced to the insurer by the producer or premium finance company on behalf of, but in the absence of a payment by, the insured. An insured shall be obligated to pay, upon written demand by the liquidator, any unpaid, earned premium due the insurer as shown on the records of the insurer.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The circuit court of the first judicial circuit shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings to hear and determine the rights of any producer, premium finance company, insured, liquidator, or any other person under this section. The circuit court of the first judicial circuit may provide that any and all proceedings arising under this section shall be referred to the judge presiding over the delinquency proceeding of the insurer. In lieu of a separate action for the collection of unpaid premiums, a producer, premium finance company, insured, or any other person who contests their liability for unpaid premiums may voluntarily submit their claim and dispute to the judge presiding over the delinquency proceeding of the insurer for summary disposition.</p>
