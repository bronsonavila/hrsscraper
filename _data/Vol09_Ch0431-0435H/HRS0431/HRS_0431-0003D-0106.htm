<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) If an insurer qualifies for exemption pursuant to subsection (a)(1), but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (a)(2), then the own risk and solvency assessment summary report required pursuant to section 431:3D-105 shall include every insurer within the insurance group. This requirement may be satisfied by the submission of more than one own risk and solvency assessment summary report for any combination of insurers; provided that any combination of reports includes every insurer within the insurance group.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (a)(1), but the insurance group of which it is a member qualifies for exemption pursuant to subsection (a)(2), then the only own risk and solvency assessment summary report required pursuant to section 431:3D-105 shall be the report applicable to that insurer.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) An insurer that does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (a) may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this article based upon unique circumstances.</p>
