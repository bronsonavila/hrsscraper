<p class="XNotes"> Section 431:10C-117 mandates that an insurer be fined if it violates this section, but gives the commissioner some discretion as to the amount of the fine; commissioner's imposition of $3,000 fine was not an abuse of discretion as it satisfied the statutory requirements. 104 H. 261, 88 P.3d 196.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section applies to both rating plans and standards, including underwriting standards; thus, commissioner and trial court correctly concluded that insurer improperly denied plaintiff's application for insurance. 104 H. 261, 88 P.3d 196.</p>
