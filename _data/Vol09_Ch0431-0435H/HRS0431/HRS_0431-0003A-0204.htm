<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[§431:3A<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">-204] Form of opt out notice to consumers and opt out methods.</span></b><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (a) A licensee shall provide an opt out notice to each of the licensee's consumers that is clear and conspicuous and accurately explains the right to opt out. The notice shall state:</span></p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) That the licensee discloses or reserves the right to disclose nonpublic personal financial information about its consumer to a nonaffiliated third party;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt out right.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (b) A licensee may provide the opt out notice together with or on the same written or electronic form as the initial notice the licensee provides in accordance with section 431:3A-201.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (c) If a licensee provides the opt out notice later than required for the initial notice in accordance with section 431:3A-201, the licensee shall also include a copy of the initial notice with the opt out notice in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (d) If two or more consumers jointly obtain an insurance product or service from a licensee, the licensee may provide a single opt out notice. The licensees opt out notice shall explain that a</span>ny of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out; provided that the licensee may:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer as applying to all of the associated joint consumers; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Permit each joint consumer to opt out separately; provided that if a licensee permits each joint consumer to opt out separately, the licensee shall permit one of the joint consumers to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">A licensee may not require all joint consumers to opt out before it implements any opt out direction.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (e) A licensee shall comply with a consumers opt out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after the licensee receives it.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (f) A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (g) A consumers direction to opt out under this section shall be effective until the consumer revokes it in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. When a customer relationship terminates, the customers opt out direction shall continue to apply to the nonpublic personal financial information that the licensee collected during or related to that relationship. If the individual subsequently establishes a new customer relationship with the licensee, the opt out direction that applied to the former relationship shall not apply to the new relationship.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (h) If a licensee is required to deliver an opt out notice by this section, the licensee shall deliver it in accordance with section 431:3A-206. [L 2001, c 220, pt of §1]</span></p>
