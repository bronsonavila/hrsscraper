<p class="XNotes"> Where management company for foreign insurer authorized to do business in Hawaii did not hold a general agent, subagent, or solicitor license under this article (1993), it could not have been legally appointed as either a general agent, subagent, or solicitor of insurer; thus it did not qualify as a "general agent", "subagent", or "solicitor" as defined by this chapter (1993), did not fall within the parameters of the category described by §237-13(7) and was thus subject to a general excise tax rate of four per cent pursuant to §237-13(6). 115 H. 180, 166 P.3d 353 (2007).</p>
