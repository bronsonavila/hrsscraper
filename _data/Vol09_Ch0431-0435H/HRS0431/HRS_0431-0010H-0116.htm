<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> [ยง431:10H-116] Nonforfeiture benefits.</b> (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), a long-term care insurance policy shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this State unless the policyholder or certificate holder has been offered an option to purchase a policy or certificate that includes a nonforfeiture benefit. The offer of a nonforfeiture benefit may be in the form of a rider that is attached to the policy. If the policyholder or certificate holder declines the nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer shall provide a contingent benefit upon lapse that shall be available for a specified period of time following a substantial increase in premium rates.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) For a group long-term care insurance policy, the offer of a nonforfeiture benefit under subsection (a) shall be made to the group policyholder. However, if the policy is issued as a group long-term care insurance, other than to a continuing care retirement community or other similar entity, the offering shall be made to each proposed certificate holder.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The commissioner shall adopt rules to specify the type of nonforfeiture benefits to be offered as part of long-term care insurance policies or certificates, the standards for nonforfeiture benefits, and the rules for contingent benefit upon lapse, including a determination of the specified period of time during which a contingent benefit upon lapse shall be available and the substantial premium rate increase that triggers a contingent benefit upon lapse as provided in subsection (a).
