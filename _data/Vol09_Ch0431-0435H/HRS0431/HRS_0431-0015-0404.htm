<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) If the commissioner finds that there are sufficient assets of the insurer located in this State to justify the appointment of an ancillary receiver; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) If the protection of creditors or policyholders in this State so requires.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The court may issue an order appointing an ancillary receiver on whatever terms it considers appropriate. The filing or recording of the order with the bureau of conveyances imparts the same notice as evidence of title.</p>

The ancillary receiver shall, as soon as practicable, liquidate from their respective securities those special deposit claims and secured claims which are proved and allowed in the ancillary proceedings in this State, and shall pay the necessary expenses of the proceedings. The ancillary receiver shall promptly transfer all remaining assets, books, accounts and records to the domiciliary liquidator. Subject to this section, the ancillary receiver and the receiver's deputies shall have the same powers and be subject to the same duties with respect to the administration of assets as a liquidator of an insurer domiciled in this State.</p>
