The tax rate shall be in the amount of 4.68 per cent of gross premiums, less return premiums, on surplus lines insurance allocated to this State. The tax rate and fees of other states shall be applied to the gross premiums, less return premiums, allocated to those states.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> As used in this subsection, "gross premiums" means the amount of the policy or coverage premium charged by the insurer in consideration for the insurance contract. Any charges for policy, survey, inspection, service, or similar fees or other charges added by the broker shall not be considered part of gross premiums.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The commissioner shall collect the taxes and fees on independently procured surplus lines insurance and from surplus lines licensees and disburse to the other states the funds earned by each state; provided that the other state has a reciprocal allocation and disbursement procedure for the benefit of this State. To the extent that other states, where portions of the properties, risks, or exposures reside, have failed to establish a reciprocal allocation and disbursement procedure with this State, the net premium tax collected shall be retained by this State.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If a surplus lines policy covers risks or exposures only partially resident in this State, the tax payable shall be computed upon the proportion of the premium which is properly allocable to the risks or exposures located in this State. The taxes and fees payable to this State on policies that cover risks and exposures only partially resident in this State shall be remitted on the quarterly schedule established by subsection (a) to the home state of the insured for disbursement to this State.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The tax on any portion of the premium unearned at the termination of the insurance contract shall be returned to the policyholder.</p>
