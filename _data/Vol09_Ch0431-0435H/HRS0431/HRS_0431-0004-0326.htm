<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The distributive share of each member shall be in the proportion that the aggregate premiums earned by the insurer on the policies of the member during the combined periods of the member's membership, bear to the aggregate of all premiums so earned on the policies of all members. If a life insurer, the insurer shall make a reasonable classification of its life insurance policies so held by the members and a formula, based upon such classification, for determining the equitable distributive share of each such member. The classification and formula shall be subject to the commissioner's approval. [L 1987, c 347, pt of ยง2]</p>
