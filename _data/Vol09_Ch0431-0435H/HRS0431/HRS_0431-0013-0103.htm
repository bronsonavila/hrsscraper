<p class="XNotes"> Violations of the unfair settlement provision, subsection (a), may be used as evidence to indicate bad faith in accordance with the guidelines of Best Place, Inc. v. Penn America Ins. Co. 27 F. Supp. 2d 1211.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> An insurer that does not respond promptly to a party's settlement demand and does not negotiate settlement in good faith may violate subsection (a)(10). 73 H. 412, 835 P.2d 627.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff may not maintain a private cause of action for an alleged violation of this section. 28 F. Supp. 2d 588.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Mentioned: 795 F. Supp. 1036; 255 F. Supp. 2d 1149.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Evidence regarding workers' compensation insurer's failure to specifically address questions posed in a letter from claimant's counsel was insufficient to show that insurer failed to respond to communications "with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice" under subsection (a)(11)(B); insurer's failure thus did not violate this section or establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding claimant's allegation that insurer breached its duty to negotiate in good faith. 112 H. 195 (App.), 145 P.3d 738 (2006).</p>
