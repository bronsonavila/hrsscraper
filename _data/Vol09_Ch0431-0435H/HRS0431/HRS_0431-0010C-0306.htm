<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Section (pre-1997) does not violate constitutional right to the equal protection of the laws as applied to persons ineligible for no-fault benefits. 87 H. 297, 955 P.2d 90.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff did not satisfy minimum level of qualifying expenses necessary to maintain action under subsection (b)(2) (1993) where plaintiff did not present: (1) evidence that medical expenses plaintiff claimed in motor vehicle tort lawsuit were paid, thereby triggering statutory presumption that they were reasonable and necessary; nor (2) expert testimony establishing that the expenses were reasonable and necessary. 88 H. 251, 965 P.2d 793.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where insured was neither involved in the car accident nor witnessed the accident involving insured's son, insured was precluded from recovering for any emotional distress under subsection (b) and First Insurance Co. of Hawaii v. Lawrence. 108 H. 380, 120 P.3d 1115 (2005).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiffs' claim did not accrue until the quantum of the medical care they actually received exceeded the medical-rehabilitative limit set forth in subsection (b)(2) (1993), and plaintiff apparently exceeded that limit, §662-4 afforded plaintiffs two years from the accrual of their claim within which to file their lawsuit; as plaintiffs' claim had accrued by the time they filed their complaint but not more than two years prior, the complaint was timely under §662-4; thus, trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss. 113 H. 459, 153 P.3d 1144 (2007).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court erred in entering judgment for defendant as subsection (b)(2) does not require that jury return verdict in excess of medical-rehabilitative limit established by §431:10C-308, but only requires that "amount paid or accrued" exceeds this limit. 80 H. 188 (App.), 907 P.2d 774.</p>
