<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Not less than one hundred and twenty days prior to the submission of a revised plan to the office, the county shall submit a copy of the proposed revision to its county advisory committee for review and comment. All revisions determined by the county advisory committee or the office to be substantial revisions shall be subject to:</p>
