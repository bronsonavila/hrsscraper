<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) A prescription for a controlled substance shall be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of the practitioner's professional practice. The responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances shall be upon the prescribing practitioner, but a corresponding responsibility shall rest with the pharmacist who fills the prescription. An order purporting to be a prescription issued not in the usual course of professional treatment or for legitimate and authorized research shall not be deemed a prescription within the meaning and intent of this section, and the person who knowingly fills such a purported prescription, as well as the person who issues the prescription, shall be subject to the penalties provided for violations of this chapter;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) A prescription may not be issued to allow an individual practitioner to obtain controlled substances for supplying the individual practitioner for the purpose of general dispensing to patients;</p>

The prescriptions may be prepared by a secretary or agent for the signature of the practitioner, but the prescribing practitioner shall be responsible in case the prescription does not conform in all essential respects to this chapter and any rules adopted pursuant to this chapter. In receiving an oral prescription from a practitioner, a pharmacist shall promptly reduce the oral prescription to writing, which shall include the following information: the drug name, strength, dosage form, quantity prescribed in figures only, and directions for use; the date the oral prescription was received; the full name, Drug Enforcement Administration registration number, and oral code number of the practitioner; and the name and address of the person for whom the controlled substance was prescribed or the name of the owner of the animal for which the controlled substance was prescribed.</p>

Failure to comply with this paragraph shall result in the suspension of that facility's privilege to fill controlled substance prescriptions at pharmacies outside of the hospital or other institution. Each written prescription shall have the name of the physician stamped, typed, or hand-printed on it, as well as the signature of the physician;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) An official exempted from registration shall include on all prescriptions issued by the official:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The official's branch of service or agency (e.g., "U.S. Army" or "Public Health Service"); and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) The official's service identification number, in lieu of the registration number of the practitioner required by this section.

A central fill pharmacy shall not prepare prescriptions for any controlled substance listed in schedule II.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (k) Partial filling of controlled substance prescriptions shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The partial filling of a prescription for a controlled substance listed in schedule II is permissible if the pharmacist is unable to supply the full quantity called for in a written, electronic prescription, or emergency oral prescription and the pharmacist makes a notation of the quantity supplied on the face of the written prescription (or written record of the electronic prescription or emergency oral prescription). The remaining portion of the prescription may be filled within seventy-two hours of the first partial filling; provided that if the remaining portion is not or cannot be filled within the seventy-two-hour period, the pharmacist shall notify the prescribing individual practitioner. No further quantity shall be supplied beyond seventy-two hours without a new prescription; </p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) A prescription for a schedule II controlled substance issued for a patient in a long-term care facility or for a patient with a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness may be filled in partial quantities to include individual dosage units. If there is any question whether a patient may be classified as having a terminal illness, the pharmacist shall contact the practitioner prior to partially filling the prescription. Both the pharmacist and the prescribing practitioner have a corresponding responsibility to assure that the controlled substance is for a terminally ill patient. The pharmacist shall record on the prescription document on file whether the patient is "terminally ill" or a "long-term care facility patient". For the purposes of this section, "TI" means terminally ill and "LTCF" means long-term care facility. A prescription that is partially filled and does not contain the notation "TI" or "LTCF patient" shall be deemed to have been filled in violation of this section. For each partial filling, the dispensing pharmacist shall record on the back of the prescription (or on another appropriate record, uniformly maintained, and readily retrievable) the date of the partial filling, quantity dispensed, remaining quantity authorized to be dispensed, and the identification of the dispensing pharmacist. The total quantity of schedule II controlled substances dispensed in all partial fillings shall not exceed the total quantity prescribed, nor shall a prescription be partially filled more than three times after the initial date of the prescription. Schedule II controlled substance prescriptions for patients in a long-term care facility or patients with a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness shall be valid for a period not to exceed thirty days from the issue date unless sooner terminated by the discontinuance of medication.</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The information shall be communicated in a retrievable, recognizable format acceptable to the intended recipient and shall include the physician's oral code designation and the name of the recipient pharmacy;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) No electronic system, software, or other intervening mechanism or party shall alter the practitioner's prescription, order entry, selection, or intended selection without the practitioner's approval on a per prescription per order basis. Facsimile prescription information shall not be altered by any system, software, or other intervening mechanism or party prior to receipt by the intended pharmacy;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) The prescription information processing system shall provide for confidentiality safeguards required by federal or state law; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Prescribing practitioners and pharmacists shall exercise prudent and professional judgment regarding the accuracy, validity, and authenticity of any facsimile prescription information. The facsimile shall serve as the original written prescription for purposes of this section and shall be maintained in accordance with section 329-36.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (m) A prescription prepared in accordance with subsection (i) written for a narcotic listed in schedule II to be compounded for the direct administration to a patient by parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intraspinal infusion, but does not extend to the dispensing of oral dosage units of controlled substances, may be transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to the pharmacy by facsimile.

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (n) A prescription prepared in accordance with subsection (i) written for a schedule II substance for a patient enrolled in a hospice care program certified or paid for by medicare under Title XVIII or a hospice program that is licensed by the State may be transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to the dispensing pharmacy by facsimile. The original prescription shall be maintained by the practitioner in accordance with section 329-36. The practitioner or practitioner's agent shall note on the prescription that the patient is a hospice patient. The pharmacist shall note on the face of the facsimile prescription in red ink "HOSPICE" and this facsimile shall serve as the original written prescription for purposes of this section and it shall be maintained in accordance with section 329-36.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (o) A prescription prepared in accordance with subsection (i) written for a schedule II controlled substance for a resident of a state-licensed long-term care facility may be transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to the dispensing pharmacy by facsimile.
