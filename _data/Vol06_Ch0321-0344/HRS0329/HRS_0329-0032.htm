The failure of the registrant to provide the documents or statements within a reasonable time after being requested to do so shall be deemed to be a waiver by the registrant of the opportunity to present the documents or statements for consideration by the department in granting or denying the registration.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (h) The failure to renew the controlled substance registration on a timely basis or to pay the applicable fees or payment with a check that is dishonored upon first deposit shall cause the registration to be automatically forfeited.
