<p class="XNotes"> Sufficiency of an environmental impact statement. 59 H. 156, 577 P.2d 1116.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Sufficiency of an environmental impact statement is a question of law. 81 H. 171, 914 P.2d 1364.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The proper inquiry for determining the necessity of an environmental impact statement (EIS) based on the language of §343-5(c) is whether the proposed action will "likely" have a significant effect on the environment; as defined in this section, "significant effect" includes irrevocable commitment of natural resources; where the burning of thousands of gallons of fuel and the withdrawal of millions of gallons of groundwater on a daily basis would "likely" cause such irrevocable commitment, an EIS was required pursuant to both the common meaning of "may" and the statutory definition of "significant effect". 106 H. 270, 103 P.3d 939.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where record in the case showed no substantive change in the project, nor any evidence that the subdivision application proposed "any use within a shoreline area as defined in §205A-41", as required in §343-5(a)(3), thereby making the subdivision application an "action" under this section that required a supplemental environmental impact statement, once the environmental impact statement had been accepted, no other statement for the proposed project was required under §343-5(g). 120 H. 457 (App.), 209 P.3d 1271. </p>
