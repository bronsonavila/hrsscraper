<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where there was no evidence that the city department of planning and permitting filed a notice with the office of environmental quality control pursuant to HAR §11-200-11.1 of its determination that a supplemental environmental impact statement was not required, there was no date from which to measure the thirty day limitation prescribed by §343-7(b) and §343-7(b) was thus inapplicable; in addition, given the plain and unambiguous language of §343-7 and this section, coupled with the related administrative rules, actual knowledge cannot be substituted for the public notice requirement. 123 H. 150, 231 P.3d 423 (2010).</p>
