The official effecting the transfer of the resident shall keep the director informed of the maximum period of commitment of the resident to the director of public safety, and, if the continued care of the resident beyond the expiration of the period is deemed necessary, the director shall institute the procedures required to detain the resident as a patient notwithstanding the resident's release from the state correctional facility; provided that a judicial hearing pursuant to sections 334-60.2 to 334-60.7 be held by the same circuit court that sentenced the resident. In the event that discharge from the facility operated by the department or at which the director contracts for services occurs before the expiration of the maximum period of commitment or confinement, the resident shall be returned to the appropriate state correctional facility.</p>
