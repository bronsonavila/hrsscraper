<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง342D-81 Declaration of policy. </b>The State's policy is to promote water pollution prevention and control, including the use of recycled water, by financing eligible projects of eligible parties consistent with applicable federal and state laws. The State intends the financing to occur through a revolving fund loan program that makes loans to eligible parties at or below market rates and a leveraging program that uses revenue bonds and revolving fund loan programs together in a coordinated manner that does not cause the state debt ceiling to be exceeded.
