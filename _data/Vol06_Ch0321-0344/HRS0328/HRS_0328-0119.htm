<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) If the conditions under which a prescription drug has been returned cast doubt on the drug's safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity, then the drug shall be either destroyed or returned to the supplier, unless examination, testing, or other investigation proves that the drug meets appropriate standards of safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity. In determining whether the conditions under which a drug has been returned cast doubt on the drug's safety, identity, strength, quality, or purity, the wholesale distributor shall consider, among other things, the conditions under which the drug has been held, stored, or shipped before or during its return and the condition of the drug and its container, carton, or labeling as a result of storage or shipping.</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (D) The recordkeeping requirements in section 328-120 shall be followed for all outdated, damaged, deteriorated, misbranded, adulterated or returned prescription drugs. [L 1992, c 196, pt of ยง2]</p>
