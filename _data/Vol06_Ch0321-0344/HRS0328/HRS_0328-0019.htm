<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §328-19 Cosmetics deemed misbranded when.</b> A cosmetic shall be deemed to be misbranded:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular, or if its labeling or packaging fails to conform with the requirements of section 328-19.1 of this part;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) If in package form, unless it bears a label containing (A) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor; and (B) an accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count, which statement shall be separately and accurately stated in a uniform location upon the principal display panel of the label; provided that under clause (B) of this paragraph reasonable variations shall be permitted, and exemptions as to small packages shall be established by regulations prescribed by the director;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) If any word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of this part to appear on the label or labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices, in the labeling) and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) If its container is so made, formed or filled as to be misleading;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) If it is a color additive, unless its packaging and labeling are in conformity with such packaging and labeling requirements applicable to the color additive prescribed under the Federal Act. This paragraph shall not apply to packages of color additives which, with respect to their use for cosmetics, are marketed and intended for use only in or on hair dyes (as defined in the last sentence of section 328-18(1));</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) Unless it is a cosmetic which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled or repacked in substantial quantities at an establishment other than the establishment where it was originally processed or packed. Such cosmetic is exempted from the affirmative labeling requirements of this part while it is in transit in commerce from the one establishment to the other, if such transit is made in good faith for such completion purposes only; but it is otherwise subject to all applicable provisions of this part.
