<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง323D-76 Acquisition in the public interest; decision of attorney general. </b>If the attorney general determines that a review of the application is appropriate, the attorney general shall approve the application unless the attorney general finds that the acquisition is not in the public interest. An acquisition of a private nonprofit hospital is not in the public interest unless appropriate steps have been taken to safeguard the value of charitable assets and ensure that any proceeds of the transaction are used for appropriate charitable health care purposes as provided in paragraph (8). In determining whether the acquisition meets such criteria, the attorney general shall consider, as applicable:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Whether the acquisition is permitted under chapter 414D governing nonprofit entities, trusts, or charities;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Whether the hospital acted in a duly diligent manner in deciding to sell, selecting the purchaser, and negotiating the terms and conditions of the sale;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The procedures used by the seller in making its decision, including whether appropriate expert assistance was used;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Whether all conflicts of interest were disclosed, including, but not limited to, conflicts of interest related to board members of, executives of, and experts retained by the seller, purchaser, or parties to the acquisition;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Whether the seller will receive reasonably fair value for its assets. The attorney general may employ, at the seller's expense, reasonably necessary expert assistance in making this determination;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) Whether charitable funds are placed at unreasonable risk, if the acquisition is financed in part by the seller;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) Whether any management contract under the acquisition is for reasonably fair value;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (8) Whether the sale proceeds will be used for appropriate charitable health care purposes consistent with the seller's original purpose or for the support and promotion of health care in the affected community, and will be controlled as charitable funds independent of the purchaser or parties to the acquisition; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (9) Whether a right of first refusal to repurchase the assets by a successor nonprofit corporation or foundation has been retained, if the hospital is subsequently sold to, acquired by, or merged with another entity. [L 1998, c 257, pt of ยง1; am L 2002, c 40, ยง10]</p>
