This lets you name another individual as your agent to make mental health treatment decisions for you, if you become incapable of making your own decisions, or if you want someone else to make those decisions for you now, even though you are still capable of making your own decisions. You may name alternate agents to act for you if your first choice is not willing, able, or reasonably available to make decisions for you. Unless related to you, your agent may not be an owner, operator, or employee of a health care institution where you are receiving care.</span></p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Part 3 of this form lets you give specific instructions about any aspect of your mental health care and treatment. Choices are provided for you to express your wishes regarding the provision, withholding, or withdrawal of medication and treatment. Space is provided for you to add to the choices you have made or for you to write out any additional wishes.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Part 4 of this form must be completed in order to activate the advance mental health care directive.

Give a copy of the signed and completed form to your physician, to any other health care providers you may have, to any health care institution at which you are receiving care, and to any mental health care agents you have named. You should talk to the persons you have named as agents to make sure that they understand your wishes and are willing to take the responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> You have the right to revoke this advance mental health care directive or replace this form at any time, unless otherwise specified in writing in the advance mental health care directive.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> If you are in imminent danger of causing bodily harm to yourself or others, or have been involuntarily committed to a health care institution for mental health treatment, the advance mental health care directive will not apply.</span></p>
