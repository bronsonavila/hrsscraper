<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง327-10 Manner of making, amending, or revoking an anatomical gift of decedent's body or body part.</b> (a) A person authorized to make an anatomical gift under section 327-9 may make an anatomical gift by a document of gift signed by the person making the gift or that person's oral communication that is electronically recorded or is contemporaneously reduced to a record and signed by the individual receiving the oral communication.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Subject to subsection (c), an anatomical gift by a person authorized under section 327-9 may be amended or revoked orally or in a record by any member of a prior class who is reasonably available; provided that any response other than an express, contrary indication regarding the decedent's anatomical gift shall prohibit amendment or revocation of an anatomical gift of the decedent's body or body parts. If more than one member of the prior class is reasonably available, the gift made by a person authorized under section 327-9 may be amended or revoked only if a majority of the reasonably available members of that class agree to the amending or revoking of the gift; provided that any response other than an express, contrary indication by the majority of the reasonably available members of that class regarding the decedent's anatomical gift shall prohibit amendment or revocation of an anatomical gift of the decedent's body or body parts.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) A revocation under subsection (b) is effective only if the procurement organization or transplant hospital or the physician or technician knows of the revocation before an incision has been made to remove a body part from the donor, or before invasive procedures have begun to prepare the recipient.
