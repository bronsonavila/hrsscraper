Nothing in this section shall preclude a registered nurse who is not licensed by the board as an advanced practice registered nurse and who is currently certified by a national certifying body recognized by the board from using another title designated by certification.

<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes">To the extent plaintiffs alleged that the nurse practitioners were not "licensed", the court rejected the claim; because an advanced practice registered nurse title is a "recognition" granted by the board--not a license--the nurse practitioners with registered nurse licenses were "licensed" under Hawaii law. 560 F. Supp. 2d 988 (2008).</p>
