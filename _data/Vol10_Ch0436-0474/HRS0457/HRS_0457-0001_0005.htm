It is also an art dedicated to caring for others. The practice of nursing means assisting clients in attaining or maintaining optimal health, implementing a strategy of care to accomplish defined goals within the context of a client-centered health care plan, and evaluating responses to nursing care and treatment. Nursing is a dynamic discipline that is continually evolving to include more sophisticated knowledge, technologies, and client care activities. Nursing applies evidence-based practice to promote optimal client outcomes.</p>
