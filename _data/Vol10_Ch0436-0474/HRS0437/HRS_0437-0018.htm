<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The bond shall be subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) That the broker will faithfully and truly comply with all the valid provisions of this chapter as the same now are or may hereafter be amended, and with any rule adopted by the board pursuant to this chapter;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) That the broker will protect the treasurer of the county and any purchaser of any vehicle or any person acquiring any lien thereon or successor in interest of any such person against any loss on account of any defect in or undisclosed encumbrance upon the title of any motor vehicle, registered by the treasurer in reliance upon any certificate, affidavit, or other representation of the dealer, or registration or transfer of registration procured by the broker.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Suit on bond. The director of commerce and consumer affairs, or any person who has been or claims to have been injured by the breach of the conditions, shall have the right of action to recover on any such bond, plus a reasonable attorney's fee incurred to secure the recovery under the bond; provided that the aggregate liability of the surety or sureties to all such persons shall in no event exceed the amount of the bond; and provided further that any award of attorney's fees shall be approved by the court and no other attorney's fees shall be permitted from the bond proceeds. Nothing in this section or chapter shall be deemed to prohibit or prevent an independent action against the broker and any other person from being joined or consolidated with an action on the bond, and the recovery of a larger amount than the amount of the bond founded upon any other cause or causes or action so joined or consolidated.
