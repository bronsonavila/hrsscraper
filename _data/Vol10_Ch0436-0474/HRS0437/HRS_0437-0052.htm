<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although the forum selection clause in a section of the distributorship agreement stated that the agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Wisconsin, the section also stated that any applicable state motor vehicle statute governing the relationship between defendant and plaintiff shall be controlling in the event of a conflict between any provision of the agreement and the state statute. Under that section's express language, because the selection of Wisconsin as the exclusive forum conflicted with paragraph (1) and §437-28.5(b), the provisions of the Hawaii Motor Vehicle Industry Licensing Act controlled. 81 F. Supp. 3d 993 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Retroactive application of paragraph (3) and §437-58 did not violate the contracts clause; plaintiff distributor was granted leave to amend to allege claims based on violation of those sections, where among other things, paragraph (3) and §437-58 substantially impaired the parties' contractual relationship. 81 F. Supp. 3d 993 (2014).</p>
