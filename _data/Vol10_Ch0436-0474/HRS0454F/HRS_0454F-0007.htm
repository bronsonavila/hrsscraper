<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a test provider approved by NMLS from providing a test at the location of the employer of the applicant, the location of any subsidiary or affiliate of the employer of the applicant, or the location of any entity with which the applicant holds an exclusive arrangement to conduct the business of a mortgage loan originator.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) An individual shall have passed a qualified written test if the individual achieves a test score of seventy-five per cent of the correct answers to questions or better.
