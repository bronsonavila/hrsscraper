<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§437B-23 Certification program</b>. (a) The board, at its sole discretion, may enter into written agreements with entities, educational institutions, and other organizations to develop and administer a certification program for motor vehicle mechanics that will provide education and training in order to ensure that the mechanics' knowledge, skills, and abilities are current with industry standards. The entities, educational institutions, and other organizations shall have the range of expertise, knowledge, and structure to provide instruction, information, guidance, and services to assist mechanics in obtaining necessary competencies to engage in motor vehicle repairs in order to protect consumers. Alternatively, the board may accept certificates from a national certification program approved by the board without the need to contract with the organization that administers the national certification program.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The certification program shall provide for issuing a certificate to mechanics generally skilled in the repair of motor vehicles and to mechanics who specialize in certain areas of motor vehicle repair. An individual may be certified as being generally skilled in the repair of motor vehicles, specially skilled in one or more areas of motor vehicle repair, or both. Each area shall be separately tested and certified. The program shall provide for apprenticeship leading to certification as a mechanic. The program may be an apprenticeship program registered with the department of labor and industrial relations in accordance with applicable governing law. Nothing in this section or chapter shall prevent a student in a course leading to certification from repairing motor vehicles so long as the student is supervised by a mechanic who is licensed in accordance with this chapter.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The certification test shall be approved by the board and, if written, shall be given orally at the request of the individual being tested. Each application for certification shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable examination fee as provided in rules adopted by the department pursuant to chapter 91.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) There shall be no limit on the number of times an individual may apply for certification; provided that an applicant who does not pass the examination shall wait at least thirty calendar days before being eligible to retake the test.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) All individuals who take and pass the certification test shall be awarded a certificate which shall be posted in a prominent place at the individual's place of business or employment and a patch which may be worn on clothing apparel. The entity, educational institution, or other organization who has entered into a written agreement with the board or been approved by the board pursuant to subsection (a) shall design and procure the certificate and patch.
