<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The failure, neglect, or refusal of any person holding a license to practice chiropractic to renew the license or to pay the renewal fee on or before December 31 of each odd-numbered year shall constitute a forfeiture of the license. A license that has been forfeited may be restored by the board upon compliance with the licensing renewal requirements provided by law and upon written application and payment of all applicable renewal fees, penalty fees, and compliance resolution fund fees within two years after the date of forfeiture. The license of any person who fails to apply for restoration of a forfeited license within two years from the date of forfeiture shall be automatically terminated. Once a license has been terminated pursuant to this section, the person may apply for a new license pursuant to and subject to all applicable laws and rules in effect at the time of application.
