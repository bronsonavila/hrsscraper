<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Which is in business at the commencement of a calendar year, as of January 1 of that year;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Which begins business after the commencement of a calendar year, as of the commencement of business.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Third year of doing business; earlier years, how governed. If the company is in business at the commencement of the calendar year, and was in business during the whole of the preceding year and prior thereto, the tax shall be returned and paid as provided in sections 239-4 and 239-7.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> However, if subsection (a)(2) applies, or if the company though in business at the commencement of the calendar year was not in business during the preceding year, or was in business during the preceding year or a part thereof but not prior thereto, the tax shall be returned and paid as provided in subsections (c) and (d).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) First year of doing business. The measure of the tax for the year in which the company begins business is an estimate of the gross income of the public service company for that year or for the part of that year in which it is in business.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The tax thereon for the year in which the company begins business shall be at the following rate:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) If subsection (a)(2) applies, at the rate of four per cent, or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) If subsection (a)(1) applies but the company though in business at the commencement of the calendar year was not in business during any part of the preceding year, the tax shall be at the rate provided by sections 239-5 and 239-6, except that there shall be no adjustment of the rate of tax on account of the ratio of the net income to the gross income being in excess of fifteen per cent and it shall be assumed for purposes of this subsection and subsection (e) that the ratio is fifteen per cent or less.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The estimate shall be made and the tax returned on or before the twentieth day of the third month after the month in which the company begins business and shall be subject to adjustment by the filing of an amended return as provided in subsection (e). Payment of the tax shall accompany the return unless time for payment is extended by the director of taxation. The extension may be granted by the director in order to provide for payment of the tax in installments during the remainder of the taxable year.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Second year of doing business. The measure of the tax for the year following the year in which the company began business is an estimate of the average gross income for a taxable year, subject to adjustment by the filing of an amended return as provided in subsection (e). The estimate shall be made and the tax returned and paid at the times provided for other companies which are in business at the commencement of the calendar year. The tax thereon shall be at the rate provided by sections 239-5 and 239-6, except that there shall be no adjustment of the rate of tax on account of the ratio of the net income to the gross income being in excess of fifteen per cent and it shall be assumed for purposes of this subsection and subsection (e) that the ratio is fifteen per cent or less.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Adjustment of estimates. An amended return shall be filed after the close of the applicable taxable year for each year for which an estimated tax return was filed under subsection (c) or (d).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> If the year for which the estimate is made is the year in which the company commenced doing business and subsection (c) applies, any variance between the estimate and the actual gross income for that year shall be adjusted and a credit or refund made, or payment of additional tax due, depending upon whether the estimate was in excess of, or less than, the actual gross income of the company for that year.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> If the year for which the estimate is made is the year following the year in which the company commenced doing business and subsection (d) applies, the average monthly gross income during the period from and after the commencement of business to the close of the year for which the estimate was made shall be determined and multiplied by twelve. Any variance between the estimate and the amount so computed shall be adjusted and a credit or refund made, or payment of additional tax due, depending upon whether the estimate was in excess of, or less than, the amount computed.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The amended return shall be made and filed and any additional tax due paid on or before the twentieth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year in which the company commenced business.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The adjustment of the tax imposed under this chapter and the making of an amended return as provided under this section shall apply only to the first and second taxable years of doing business.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) Acquisition of business of another company. Whenever any public service company subject for any year to the tax imposed by this chapter, shall have acquired by purchase or otherwise during the preceding year the business or any part thereof of another public service company liable to tax under this chapter for the preceding year but not liable for the year following the sale or disposition, and the acquiring company continues the operation of the business so acquired, the gross income to be reported by the acquiring company for the purpose of determining the amount of its tax under this chapter for the year following the year in which the business was so acquired shall include, in addition to the gross income of the acquiring company during the year ending December 31 or fiscal year preceding, whichever is applicable, the gross income of the business or part thereof so acquired for the portion of the preceding year as the business was not operated by the acquiring company.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> This subsection shall not apply to any company whose tax for the year involved is measured under subsection (c) by an estimate of gross income for the year subject to adjustment after the close of the year.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> If the first paragraph of this subsection applies but the tax of the acquiring company for the year is governed by subsection (d) and adjusted under subsection (e), then in determining the average monthly gross income for that purpose there shall be included, in addition to the gross income of the acquiring company for the period involved in the determination of the average, the gross income of the business or part thereof acquired by the company for the portion of that period in which the business was not operated by the acquiring company.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) Consolidation or merger. Whenever there is a consolidation or merger of public service companies, liability to the tax imposed by this chapter shall attach to the company thus formed and the gross income which shall be used for measuring the tax of the company thus formed shall include the gross income of the companies which were consolidated or merged.
