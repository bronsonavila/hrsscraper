The return shall be signed by the taxpayer, if made by an individual, or by the president, vice-president, secretary, or treasurer of a corporation, if made on behalf of a corporation. If made on behalf of a partnership, firm, society, unincorporated association, group, hui, joint adventure, joint stock company, corporation, trust estate, decedent's estate, trust, or other entity, any individual delegated by the entity shall sign the same on behalf of the taxpayer. If for any reason it is not practicable for the individual taxpayer to sign the return, it may be done by any duly authorized agent. The department, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making the return on the application of any taxpayer and grant such reasonable additional time within which to make the same as may, by it, be deemed advisable.</p>
