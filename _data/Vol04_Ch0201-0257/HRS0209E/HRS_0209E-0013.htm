If the county governing body is unable or unwilling to provide any of the incentives set forth in section 209E-12 or other incentives acceptable to the department, the enterprise zone shall terminate. Qualified businesses located in the enterprise zone shall be eligible to receive the state tax incentives provided by this chapter even though the zone designation has terminated. No business may become a qualified business after the date of zone termination. The county governing body may amend its application with the approval of the department; provided the county governing body proposes an incentive equal to or superior to the unamended application.
