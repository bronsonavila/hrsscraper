<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Existence of chapter does not preclude private right of action to force beach access. 65 H. 383, 652 P.2d 1130 (1982).</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Chapter requires county planning commission to give cultural interests asserted by public interest group "full consideration" and obligates commission to "preserve and protect" native Hawaiian rights to the extent feasible when issuing SMA permits. 79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246 (1995).</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> No private right of action for damages existed for commercial tour boat operators under Kauai county's special management area rules (Hanalei Estuary Management Plan) or under Hawaii administrative rules, chapter 256, entitled "Ocean Recreation Management Rules and Areas", as promulgated under this chapter and chapter 200, respectively, where both rules were not promulgated with the objective of protecting business interests or competition, but rather with the objective of protecting and preserving the environment for the general public. 110 H. 302, 132 P.3d 1213 (2006).</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> As this chapter and the Kauai county planning commission's rules did not prohibit developer from proposing the developer's shoreline setback in developer's application for the special management area use permit, and commission was not prohibited from accepting the developer's setback in approving the permit, the commission's use of the developer's setback was consistent with the plain language in the permit order, as also reflected in plaintiff's deed; thus, commission's imposition of developer's setback on plaintiff's land was justified. 115 H. 477, 168 P.3d 929 (2007).</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Where the city council did not delegate the power to determine the effects on archeological resources and the means to protect the resources to a private petitioner, and conditioned the issuance of any development permit for the rail project on its receipt of documentation that a programmatic agreement to minimize and mitigate adverse effects on historic properties as generally described in the final environmental impact statement had been executed, the city and State gave full consideration to cultural and historic values as required under this chapter. 128 H. 53, 283 P.3d 60 (2012).</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Chapter does not apply to any development, existing or planned, for which permits listed in L 1975, c 176, §3 were issued or ordinances were passed prior to December 1, 1975. 4 H. App. 304, 666 P.2d 177 (1983).</span></p>
