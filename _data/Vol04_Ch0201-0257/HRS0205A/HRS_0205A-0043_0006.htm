<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Because the agency or department is given exclusive power to enforce setbacks, plaintiffs, a company that owned a lot in a luxury subdivision and the managers of the company, were not the appropriate party to bring an action against defendants for an alleged violation of a setback. 338 F. Supp. 2d 1106 (2004).</span></p>
