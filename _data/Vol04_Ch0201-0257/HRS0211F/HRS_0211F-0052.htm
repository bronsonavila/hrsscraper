<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) During the term of any contract with a program manager, the corporation shall conduct an examination of the program manager and its handling of accounts.

Contributions shall be used for venture capital investment. Investment may be made in any manner the program deems correct. If no venture capital investment is available at the time a contribution is made to the program, the program manager may invest the contribution in any manner allowed a regulated investment company until a venture capital investment opportunity occurs. While the program manager should make a best effort to make venture capital investments as defined in section 211F-51, if no such venture capital investment is available in Hawaii, then the program manager may make venture capital investments outside Hawaii.</p>
