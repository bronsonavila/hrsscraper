<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'></span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Although chapter 266 did not explicitly confer authority over the Kewalo Basin harbor on the Hawaii community development authority (HCDA), it was undisputed that (1) the legislature conveyed title to the fast and submerged lands within an area that includes the harbor to HCDA; (2) HCDA was given the mandate to redevelop the area that includes the harbor; and (3) HCDA was given broad rulemaking powers over its projects and properties to implement its mandate pursuant to §206E-33 and this section; thus, circuit court did not err by failing to find that the department of transportation had exclusive jurisdiction over harbor. 124 H. 313 (App.), 243 P.3d 273 (2010).</span></p>
