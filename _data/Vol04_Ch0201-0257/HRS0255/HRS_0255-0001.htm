Any taxpayer having income from business activity which is taxable both within and without this State, other than activity as a financial organization or public utility or the rendering of purely personal services by an individual, shall allocate and apportion the taxpayer's net income as provided in this Article. If a taxpayer has income from business activity as a public utility but derives the greater percentage of the taxpayer's income from activities subject to this Article, the taxpayer may elect to allocate and apportion the taxpayer's entire net income as provided in this Article.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 3. For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this Article, a taxpayer is taxable in another State if (1) in that State the taxpayer is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax, or (2) that State has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether in fact, the State does or does not.</p>

If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the taxpayer, tangible personal property is utilized in the State in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) A patent is utilized in a State to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the State or to the extent that a patented product is produced in the State. If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to States or if the accounting procedures do not reflect States of utilization, the patent is utilized in the State in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) A copyright is utilized in a State to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the State. If the basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit allocation to States or if the accounting procedures do not reflect States of utilization, the copyright is utilized in the State in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 11. Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 12. The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period but the tax administrator may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer's property.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 13. The payroll is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the State during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (a) the individual's service is performed entirely within the State;</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (a) the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States Government, within this State regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) the income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this State and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this State than in any other State, based on costs of performance.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 18. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this Article do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this State, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable:</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (a) separate accounting;</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) the exclusion of any one or more of the factors;</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) the inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer's business activity in this State; or</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 1. Each purchaser liable for a use tax on tangible personal property shall be entitled to full credit for the combined amount or amounts of legally imposed sales or use taxes paid by him with respect to the same property to another State and any subdivision thereof. The credit shall be applied first against the amount of any use tax due the State, and any unused portion of the credit shall then be applied against the amount of any use tax due a subdivision.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 1. This Article shall be in force only in those party States that specifically provide therefor by statute.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 2. Any party State or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records or other documents may request the Commission to perform the audit on its behalf. In responding to the request, the Commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise.

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 3. The Commission may require the attendance of any person within the State where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such State for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, document, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit. If the person is not within the jurisdiction, he may be required to attend for such purpose at any time and place fixed by the Commission within the State of which he is a resident; provided that such State has adopted this Article.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 4. The Commission may apply to any court having power to issue compulsory process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this Article and any and all such courts shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court. If the party or subject matter on account of which the Commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the court to which application is made, such application may be to a court in the State or subdivision on behalf of which the audit is being made or a court in the State in which the object of the order being sought is situated.

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 5. The Commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance. If the Commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party States or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the Commission.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 6. Information obtained by any audit pursuant to this Article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party States, their subdivisions or the United States. Availability of information shall be in accordance with the laws of the States or subdivisions on whose account the Commission performs the audit, and only through the appropriate agencies or officers of such States or subdivisions. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require any taxpayer to keep records for any period not otherwise required by law.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 7. Other arrangements made or authorized pursuant to law for cooperative audit by or on behalf of the party States or any of their subdivisions are not superseded or invalidated by this Article.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 8. In no event shall the Commission make any charge against a taxpayer for an audit.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 9. As used in this Article, "tax", in addition to the meaning ascribed to it in Article II, means any tax or license fee imposed in whole or in part for revenue purposes.</p>

<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center">Article IX. Arbitration.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 1. Whenever the Commission finds a need for settling disputes concerning apportionments and allocations by arbitration, it may adopt a regulation placing this Article in effect, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 2. The Commission shall select and maintain an Arbitration Panel composed of officers and employees of State and local governments and private persons who shall be knowledgeable and experienced in matters of tax law and administration.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 3. Whenever a taxpayer who has elected to employ Article IV, or whenever the laws of the party State or subdivision thereof are substantially identical with the relevant provisions of Article IV, the taxpayer, by written notice to the Commission and to each party State or subdivision thereof that would be affected, may secure arbitration of an apportionment or allocation, if he is dissatisfied with the final administrative determination of the tax agency of the State or subdivision with respect thereto on the ground that it would subject him to double or multiple taxation by two or more party States or subdivisions thereof. Each party State and subdivision thereof hereby consents to the arbitration as provided herein, and agrees to be bound thereby.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 4. The Arbitration Board shall be composed of one person selected by the taxpayer, one by the agency or agencies involved, and one member of the Commission's Arbitration Panel. If the agencies involved are unable to agree on the person to be selected by them, such person shall be selected by lot from the total membership of the Arbitration Panel. The two persons selected for the Board in the manner provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall jointly select the third member of the Board. If they are unable to agree on the selection, the third member shall be selected by lot from among the total membership of the Arbitration Panel. No member of a Board selected by lot shall be qualified to serve if he is an officer or employee or is otherwise affiliated with any party to the arbitration proceeding. Residence within the jurisdiction of a party to the arbitration proceeding shall not constitute affiliation within the meaning of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 5. The Board may sit in any State or subdivision party to the proceeding, in the State of the taxpayer's incorporation, residence or domicile, in any State where the taxpayer does business, or in any place that it finds most appropriate for gaining access to evidence relevant to the matter before it.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 6. The Board shall give due notice of the times and places of its hearings. The parties shall be entitled to be heard, to present evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. The Board shall act by majority vote.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 7. The Board shall have power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents, and issue commissions to take testimony. Subpoenas may be signed by any member of the Board. In case of failure to obey a subpoena, and upon application by the Board, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction of the State in which the Board is sitting or in which the person to whom the subpoena is directed may be found may make an order requiring compliance with the subpoena, and the court may punish failure to obey the order as a contempt. The provisions of this paragraph apply only in States that have adopted this Article.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 8. Unless the parties otherwise agree the expenses and other costs of the arbitration shall be assessed and allocated among the parties by the Board in such manner as it may determine. The Commission shall fix a schedule of compensation for members of Arbitration Boards and of other allowable expenses and costs. No officer or employee of a State or local government who serves as a member of a Board shall be entitled to compensation therefor unless he is required on account of his service to forego the regular compensation attaching to his public employment, but any such Board member shall be entitled to expenses.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 9. The Board shall determine the disputed apportionment or allocation and any matters necessary thereto. The determinations of the Board shall be final for purposes of making the apportionment or allocation, but for no other purpose.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 10. The Board shall file with the Commission and with each tax agency represented in the proceeding: the determination of the Board; the Board's written statement of its reasons therefor; the record of the Board's proceedings; and any other documents required by the arbitration rules of the Commission to be filed.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 11. The Commission shall publish the determination of Boards together with the statements of the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 12. The Commission shall adopt and publish rules of procedure and practice and shall file a copy of such rules and of any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the States.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 13. Nothing contained herein shall prevent at any time a written compromise of any matter or matters in dispute, if otherwise lawful, by the parties to the arbitration proceeding.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center">Article X. Entry Into Force and Withdrawal.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 1. This Compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any seven States. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other State upon its enactment thereof. The Commission shall arrange for notification of all party States whenever there is a new enactment of the compact.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 2. Any party State may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. No withdrawal shall effect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party State prior to the time of such withdrawal.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> 3. No proceeding commenced before an Arbitration Board prior to the withdrawal of a State and to which the withdrawing State or any subdivision thereof is a party shall be discontinued or terminated by the withdrawal, nor shall the Board thereby lose jurisdiction over any of the parties to the proceeding necessary to make a binding determination therein.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center">Article XI. Effect on Other Laws and Jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (a) Affect the power of any State or subdivision thereof to fix rates of taxation, except that a party State shall be obligated to implement Article III 2 of this Compact.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Apply to any tax or fixed fee imposed for the registration of a motor vehicle or any tax on motor fuel, other than a sales tax; provided that the definition of "tax" in Article VIII 9 may apply for the purpose of that Article and the Commission's powers of study and recommendation pursuant to Article VI 3 may apply.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Withdraw or limit the jurisdiction of any State or local court or administrative officer or body with respect to any person, corporation or other entity or subject matter, except to the extent that such jurisdiction is expressly conferred by or pursuant to this compact upon another agency or body.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Supersede or limit the jurisdiction of any court of the United States.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center">Article XII. Construction and Severability.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any State participating therein, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party States and in full force and effect as to the State affected as to all severable matters.
