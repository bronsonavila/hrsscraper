<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §249-14 Bicycle fee.</b> (a) Bicycles having two tandem wheels that are twenty inches or more in diameter are required to be registered and shall be subject to a permanent registration fee of $15, to be paid by the owners thereof to the director of finance.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> </b>(b) An owner of a bicycle having two tandem wheels that are less than twenty inches in diameter is not required to register that bicycle, but may do so to facilitate the return of recovered stolen bicycles by payment of the registration fee. The fee collected shall not be refunded or prorated. Upon receipt of the fee, the director of finance shall number and register each bicycle for which the fee is paid, in the owner's name, and furnish the owner with a metallic tag or decal for each bicycle, which shall be attached to the bicycle. The decal shall be affixed to a bicycle on the upright post attached to the sprocket facing in the forward direction. Upon initial registration by an owner or transferee, the director of finance shall require proof of ownership and require the owner to furnish verification of the serial number and description contained in the proof of ownership and application for registration. The metallic tags or decals shall be in a form as the director of finance shall from time to time prescribe. It shall be the duty of the director of finance of each county to purchase a sufficient number of these tags or decals.</p>
