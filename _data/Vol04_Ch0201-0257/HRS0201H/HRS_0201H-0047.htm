<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, the corporation's share of appreciation in the real property described in paragraph (4)(D):</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) Shall apply when the sales price of the real property that is developed and sold under this chapter is less than the then-current, unencumbered, fair market value of the real property as determined by a real property appraisal obtained prior to the closing of the sale;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) Shall be a restriction that runs with the land until it is paid in full and released by the corporation, or extinguished pursuant to subsection (f); and</p>
