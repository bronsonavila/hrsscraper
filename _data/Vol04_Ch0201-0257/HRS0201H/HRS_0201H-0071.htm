Upon the filing, the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged and thereafter received by the corporation shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be prior to the lien of all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the corporation, irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. This section shall apply to any financing statement heretofore or hereafter filed with the bureau of conveyances with respect to any pledge made to secure revenue bonds issued under this part.</p>
