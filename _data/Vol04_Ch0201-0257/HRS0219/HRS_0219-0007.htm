<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Interest charged on an insured loan made under the provisions of this section shall be determined by the board;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) When the application for an insured loan has been approved by the department, the department shall issue to the lender a guaranty for that percentage of the loan on which it insures payment of principal and interest. The lender shall collect all payments from the borrower and otherwise service the loan;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) In return for the department's guaranty, the lender shall remit a one-time insurance fee of two per cent on the principal amount of the insured portion of the loan, at the time the loan is booked, except that:</p>

The department shall be reimbursed for any amounts so paid plus the applicable interest rate, where payment is collected from the borrower;</p>

Foreclosure proceedings shall be held in abeyance in the interim; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (9) The lender may reduce the percentage of the principal balance insured under this section at any time. [L 1977, c 212, pt of ยง2; am L 1995, c 79, ยง2; am L 2001, c 55, ยง8(2)]</p>
