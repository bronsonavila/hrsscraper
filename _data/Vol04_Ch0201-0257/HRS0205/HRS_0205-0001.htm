<p class="XNotes"> A member of the land use commission did not qualify as a de facto officer, where, among other things, the senate rejected the member's nomination for a second term, which effectively served as public notice that the member was ineligible to serve as a holdover member. 132 H. 184, 320 P.3d 849 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The intermediate court of appeals erred in determining that a member of the land use commission continued to serve as a valid holdover after the senate's rejection of the member's nomination for a second term; the member's actions with respect to a petition to reclassify land were invalid. 132 H. 184, 320 P.3d 849 (2013).</p>
