<p class="XNotes"> Article XI, §9 of the Hawaii constitution is self-executing, and §205-12 imposes "reasonable limitations and regulations" that were applicable to the case which allowed the private right of action to enforce this chapter. 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Charter school failed to establish that community association's claim under this chapter was moot, and even if the case was moot, the public interest exception applied as (1) appeals court ruling that there was no private right of action under this chapter injected the requisite degree of public concern; (2) public officials needed guidance as to whether private citizens have a private right of action to enforce this chapter; and (3) given the volume of land in this State and the frequency with which issues relating to this chapter have been litigated, the question of private party enforcement was likely to recur in the future. 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> In the circumstances of the case, article XI, §9 of the Hawaii constitution created a private right of action to enforce this chapter, and the legislature confirmed the existence of that right of action by enacting §607-25, which allows for the recovery of attorneys' fees in such actions. 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> This chapter is a law relating to environmental quality within the meaning of article XI, §9 of the Hawaii constitution. 123 H. 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As no private cause of action exists to enforce this chapter, appellants lacked standing to prosecute their claim under this chapter against landowner and circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider this claim. 119 H. 164 (App.), 194 P.3d 1126 (2008).</p>
