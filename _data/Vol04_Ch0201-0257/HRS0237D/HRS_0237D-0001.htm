<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Department" means the department of taxation.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Director" means the director of taxation.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Fair market rental value" means an amount equal to one-half of the gross daily maintenance fees that are paid by the owner and are attributable to the time share unit located in Hawaii. Gross daily maintenance fees include maintenance costs, operational costs, insurance, repair costs, administrative costs, taxes, other than transient accommodations taxes, resort fees, and other costs including payments required for reserves or sinking funds. Amounts paid for optional goods and services such as food and beverage services or beach chair or umbrella rentals shall be excluded from fair market rental value.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Gross rental" or "gross rental proceeds" means the gross receipts, cash or accrued, of the taxpayer received as compensation for the furnishing of transient accommodations and the value proceeding or accruing from the furnishing of such accommodations without any deductions on account of the cost of property or services sold, the cost of materials used, labor cost, taxes, royalties, interest, discounts, or any other expenses whatsoever. Every taxpayer shall be presumed to be dealing on a cash basis unless the taxpayer proves to the satisfaction of the department of taxation that the taxpayer is dealing on an accrual basis and the taxpayer's books are so kept, or unless the taxpayer employs or is required to employ the accrual basis for the purposes of the tax imposed by chapter 237 for any taxable year in which event the taxpayer shall report the taxpayer's gross income for the purposes of this chapter on the accrual basis for the same period.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The words "gross rental" or "gross rental proceeds" shall not be construed to include the amounts of taxes imposed by chapter 237 or this chapter on operators of transient accommodations and passed on, collected, and received from the consumer as part of the receipts received as compensation for the furnishing of transient accommodations. Where transient accommodations are furnished through arrangements made by a travel agency or tour packager at noncommissionable negotiated contract rates and the gross income is divided between the operator of transient accommodations on the one hand and the travel agency or tour packager on the other hand, gross rental or gross rental proceeds to the operator means only the respective portion allocated or distributed to the operator, and no more. For purposes of this definition, where the operator maintains a schedule of rates for identifiable groups of individuals, such as kamaainas, upon which the accommodations are leased, let, or rented, gross rental or gross rental proceeds means the receipts collected and received based upon the scheduled rates and recorded as receipts in its books and records.</p>
