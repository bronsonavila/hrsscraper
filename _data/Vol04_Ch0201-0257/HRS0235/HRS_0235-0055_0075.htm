<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="color:black"> </span></span>(b) For a part-year resident, the tax credit shall equal the amount of the tax credit calculated in subsection (a) multiplied by the ratio of Hawaii adjusted gross income to federal adjusted gross income.</p>
