<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) In the case of a taxable year beginning in 1966 and ending in 1967, the entire amount of all net operating loss deductions carried back to the taxable year shall be limited to that portion of taxable income for such taxable year which the number of days in 1967 bears to the total days in the taxable year ending in 1967; and</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) In computing the net operating loss deduction allowed by this subsection, there shall be included in gross income the amount of interest which is excluded from gross income by subsection (a), decreased by the amount of interest paid or accrued which is disallowed as a deduction by subsection (e).

<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) The election to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a net operating loss allowed under section 172(b)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be operative for the purposes of this chapter; provided that no taxpayer shall make such an election as to a net operating loss of a business where such net operating loss occurred in the taxpayer's business prior to the taxpayer entering business in this State; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) The five-year carryback period for net operating losses for any taxable year ending during 2001 and 2002 in section 172(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code as it read on December 31, 2008, shall not be operative for purposes of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) The election for the carryback for 2008 or 2009 net operating losses of small businesses as provided in section 172(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code as it read on December 31, 2009, shall not be operative for purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) There shall be disallowed as a deduction the amount of interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness incurred or continued, (1) to purchase or carry bonds the interest upon which is excluded from gross income by subsection (a); or (2) to purchase or carry property owned without the State, or to carry on trade or business without the State, if the taxpayer is a person taxable only upon income from sources in the State.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) Losses of property as the result of tidal wave, hurricane, earthquake, or volcanic eruption, or as a result of flood waters overflowing the banks or walls of a river or stream, or from any other natural disaster, to the extent of the amount deductible, under this chapter, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, may be deducted in the taxable year in which sustained, or at the option of the taxpayer may be deducted in equal installments over a period of five years, the first such year to be the calendar year or fiscal year of the taxpayer in which such loss occurred.
