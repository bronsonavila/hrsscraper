If the tax credits claimed by a taxpayer exceed the amount of income tax payment due from the taxpayer, the excess of credits over payments due shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided that tax credits properly claimed by [an] individual who has no income tax liability shall be paid to the individual; and provided further that no refunds or payment on account of the tax credits allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) All claims for tax credits under this section, including any amended claims, shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credits may be claimed.
