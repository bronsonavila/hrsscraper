<p class="XNotes"> Civil union partners have all the same rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities under the law as married couples who are of the opposite gender; civil union partners have the same tax filing status options as married couples who are of the opposite gender for Hawaii income tax purposes for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2011. Att. Gen. Op. 11-2.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Definitions of "marriage" and "spouse" under the federal Defense of Marriage Act, Pub. L. No. 104-199, 110 Stat. 2419, may preclude civil union partners of the same gender under the State's Civil Union Act from filing jointly for federal income tax purposes, but they do not preclude civil union partners from filing joint tax returns for Hawaii income tax purposes. Att. Gen. Op. 11-2.</p>
