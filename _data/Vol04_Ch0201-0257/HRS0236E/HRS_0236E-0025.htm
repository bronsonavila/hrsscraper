A claim of confidentiality shall not prohibit the dissemination of tax information required under this section and shall not constitute grounds for failing or refusing to surrender the tax information to the department in the administration and enforcement of this chapter. Any tax information submitted in compliance with this section shall be treated and afforded with the same confidentiality as a return filed under section 235-116. <span class="CharacterStyle1">[L 2012, c 220, pt of ยง1]</span></p>
