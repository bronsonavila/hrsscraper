<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where charter was not recorded, and because homeowner association's first amended declaration could not reasonably be interpreted as creating the requisite authority in the association to impose a mandatory payment of money for maintenance or services, the association was not an "association" under the plain meaning of this section; thus, association was not entitled to fees and costs pursuant to §421J-10. 114 H. 361, 162 P.3d 1277 (2007).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where homeowners' association did not qualify as an association because it was not granted authority in a declaration satisfying the statutory definition of "association" in this section, trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees and costs pursuant to §421J-10. 112 H. 356 (App.), 145 P.3d 899 (2006).</p>
