<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) If the professional corporation does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the director that each ground determined by the director does not exist within sixty days after the date of mailing of the director's written notice, the director shall administratively dissolve the corporation by signing a decree of dissolution that recites any grounds for dissolution and its effective date. The decree shall be filed in the director's office. The administrative dissolution of a corporation shall not terminate the authority of its registered agent.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Within the applicable reinstatement period, should the name of the professional corporation, or a name substantially identical thereto, be registered or reserved by another entity or if that name or a name substantially identical is registered as a trade name, trademark, or service mark, then reinstatement shall be allowed only upon the registration of a new name by the administratively dissolved professional corporation pursuant to the amendment provisions of this chapter.</p>
