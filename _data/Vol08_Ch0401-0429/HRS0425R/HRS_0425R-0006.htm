<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The commercial registered agent shall promptly furnish each entity represented by it with notice in a record of the filing of the commercial registered agent termination statement.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) When a commercial registered agent termination statement takes effect, the registered agent ceases to be an agent for service of process on each entity formerly represented by it.
