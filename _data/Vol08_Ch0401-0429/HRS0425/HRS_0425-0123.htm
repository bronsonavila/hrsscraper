<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Partners in a joint venture have a statutory duty of loyalty and good faith to refrain from self-dealing; a breach of fiduciary duty in this context is not barred by the economic loss rule because the duty arises not only from the contract but also from partnership principles. 780 F. Supp. 2d 1061 (2011).</p>
