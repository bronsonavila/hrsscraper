Such extension shall be effective from the original filing of the certificate.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Within the applicable two-year period, should the name of the limited partnership, or a name substantially identical, be registered or reserved by another entity or should such name or a name substantially identical be registered as a trade name, trademark, or service mark, then extension of its term of existence shall be allowed only upon the registration of a new name by the limited partnership pursuant to the amendment provisions of this chapter.
