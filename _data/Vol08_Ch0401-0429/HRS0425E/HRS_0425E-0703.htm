<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> [ยง425E-<strong>703] Rights of creditors of partners or transferees. </strong></b>(a) On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner or transferee, the court may charge the transferable interest of the judgment debtor with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of a transferee. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor in respect of the partnership and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or which the circumstances of the case may require to give effect to the charging order.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's transferable interest. The court may order a foreclosure upon the interest subject to the charging order at any time. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) At any time before foreclosure, an interest charged may be redeemed:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) By the judgment debtor;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) With property other than limited partnership property, by one or more of the other partners; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) With limited partnership property, by the limited partnership with the consent of all partners whose interests are not so charged.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) This chapter shall not deprive any partner or transferee of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the partner's or transferee's transferable interest.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's transferable interest. [L 2003, c 210, pt of ยง1]</p>
