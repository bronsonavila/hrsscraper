<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The amount of the refund on a loan with an original term of sixty months or less shall be computed under a method no less favorable to the borrower than the Rule of 78ths method (also known as the Sum of the Digits method).

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) No refund less than $1 need be made and the financial services loan company shall not be required to refund any portion of the unearned interest that has been paid in advance which results in a minimum interest retained on the precomputed loan of less than $15.
