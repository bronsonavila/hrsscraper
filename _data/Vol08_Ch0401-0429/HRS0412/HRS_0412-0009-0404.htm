<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Alternatively, a depository financial services loan company, with the prior approval of the commissioner, may comply with the lending limits applicable to federal financial institutions as and to the same extent it would, at the time, be so required by federal law or regulation if it were a federal financial institution. A depository financial services loan company utilizing this alternative shall use a single method for calculating lending limits, including any credit exposure to the person arising from a derivative transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse purchase agreement, securities lending transaction, or securities borrowing transaction between the depository financial services loan company and the person. In monitoring a depository financial services loan company's compliance with the federal financial institution lending limits, the commissioner shall give substantial weight to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's regulations and opinions interpreting the federal financial institution lending limits, including but not limited to those related to the internal model method or the conversion factor matrix method for calculating credit exposure to derivative transactions as described in title 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 32 of the Interim Rule<b> </b>as may be amended. The commissioner will regard the regulations and opinions as strong evidence of safe and sound banking practices. [L 1993, c 350, pt of §1; am L 2013, c 172, §9]</p>
