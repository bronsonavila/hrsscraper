<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The existence, charters, licenses, and certificates of authority of Hawaii financial institutions or foreign financial institutions formed or existing on July1, 1993, are not affected by the enactment of this chapter nor by any change made thereby in the requirements for the formation of Hawaii financial institutions or chartering, licensing or certification of Hawaii financial institutions or foreign financial institutions, nor by the amendment or repeal thereby of the laws under which they were formed, created, chartered, licensed or certified.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Except to the extent specifically provided in this chapter, the power and authority of financial institutions existing on July1, 1993, shall not be limited or restricted in any way by the enactment of this chapter nor by the amendment or repeal of the laws under which they were formed or created, or which granted such power and authority. Except to the extent specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, no federal powers granted to Hawaii financial institutions prior to July1, 1993, under Act 258, Session Laws of Hawaii 1969, as amended, Act 179, Session Laws of Hawaii 1969, as amended, and Act 125, Session Laws of Hawaii 1977, as amended, shall be limited or restricted in any way by the enactment of this chapter.</p>
