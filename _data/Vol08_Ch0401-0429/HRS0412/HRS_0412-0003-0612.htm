<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Unless the requirement for an application is waived by the commissioner, the proposed acquirer shall file an application with the commissioner pursuant to section 412:3-603 for approval to acquire control of the Hawaii financial institution or financial institution holding company.

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Approval may be denied by the commissioner for the proposed acquisition of control if it appears that:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The overall experience, moral character, or integrity of any person who would acquire control of a Hawaii financial institution or financial institution holding company or become a financial institution holding company indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors, beneficiaries, creditors, or shareholders of the Hawaii financial institution or the financial institution holding company, or in the public interest, to permit the person to control the Hawaii financial institution or the financial institution holding company or to become a financial institution holding company;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The acquisition will not promote the convenience, needs, and advantage of the general public, particularly in the community in which the affected institution conducts its business;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The effect of the proposed acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly or restraint of trade in any section of the country that includes this State or a part thereof, and that these anti-competitive effects are not clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the acquisition in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) The financial condition of any person who would acquire control of a Hawaii financial institution or a financial institution holding company or become a financial institution holding company may jeopardize the safety and soundness of the Hawaii financial institution or the financial institution holding company or prejudice the interests of the depositors, beneficiaries, creditors, or shareholders of the Hawaii financial institution or the financial institution holding company;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Any plan or proposal to liquidate, merge, or consolidate, or make any other major change in the business, corporate structure, or management of the Hawaii financial institution or the financial institution holding company or any of its significant subsidiaries is not fair and reasonable to the depositors, beneficiaries, creditors, or shareholders of the Hawaii financial institution or the financial institution holding company or any of its significant subsidiaries; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) The acquiring person has failed or refused to furnish information requested by the commissioner.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) As a condition for approving the proposed acquisition of control, the commissioner shall impose a reasonable time period, not to exceed one year, within which the acquisition of control must occur.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) The commissioner may waive the requirement for approval of an acquisition of control of a financial institution holding company which indirectly controls a nondepository financial services loan company, provided that publication in a form approved by the commissioner is made. The publication shall state the fact that a change of control will take place and shall describe the effect, if any, on the operations and employees of the nondepository financial services loan company. Publication shall be made once in a newspaper of general circulation. [L 1993, c 350, pt of ยง1; am L 2006, c 228, ยง30]</p>
