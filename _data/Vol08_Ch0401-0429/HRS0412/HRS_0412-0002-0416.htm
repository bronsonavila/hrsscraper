<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The receiver shall not pay any claims against the Hawaii financial institution except regular costs and expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the receivership and the permitted operations of the financial institution, unless prior approval is obtained from the commissioner or the court.

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Unsecured claims for wages, salaries, commissions, including vacation, severance or sick leave pay, earned by an individual within ninety days before the receivership, in an amount not exceeding $2,000 for each individual;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Claims which are given priority by applicable statutes and, if the assets are insufficient for the payment in full of all such claims, in the order provided by such statutes, or in the absence of contrary provisions, pro rata;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) All other claims pro rata, exclusive of claims set forth in paragraph (5) of this section; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Claims for debts that are subordinated to unsecured claims under a written subordination agreement or other instrument.</p>
