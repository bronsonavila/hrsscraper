<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Whether any federal agency is prepared to offer financial assistance to facilitate the acquisition or merger, and the amount of such assistance;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Whether the effect of the proposed acquisition or merger may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly or restraint of trade in any section of the country that includes the State or a part thereof, and whether these anti-competitive effects would be clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the acquisition in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) The convenience and needs of the public;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) The welfare of the depositors and creditors of the failing financial institution;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (9) Any other factors which the commissioner may deem relevant.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The commissioner may negotiate with all or any of the applicants to modify any proposal, may accept more than one proposal if one involves only part of the assets or stock of the failing financial institution, and may condition any approval of an application upon the observance of such requirements as the commissioner deems appropriate. Nothing in this section shall require the commissioner to approve any application or accept any proposal made pursuant to this part. [L 1993, c 350, pt of ยง1]</p>
