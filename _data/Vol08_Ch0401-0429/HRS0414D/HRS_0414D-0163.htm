<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not the director met the standard of conduct set forth in section 414D‑160(a) or was found liable as described in section 414D‑160(d), but if the director was found liable indemnification is limited to reasonable expenses incurred.
