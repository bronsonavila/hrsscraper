Before the director declares a limited liability company terminated, the director shall mail a notice of the grounds for termination to the company and may give public notice of the intention to terminate the limited liability company.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) If the limited liability company does not correct each ground for termination or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the director that each ground determined by the director does not exist within sixty days after mailing of the notice of intention to terminate the limited liability company, the director shall administratively terminate the company by signing a decree of termination that recites the ground or grounds for termination and its effective date. The decree shall be filed in the director's office.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) A limited liability company administratively terminated continues its existence temporarily but may carry on only business necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs under section 428-802 and to notify claimants under section 428-807. The company ceases existence upon the completion of these matters.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The administrative termination of a limited liability company does not terminate the authority of its agent for service of process.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Any manager, member, or creditor of an administratively terminated limited liability company may petition the circuit court to appoint a trustee to settle its affairs. If a trustee is appointed, the trustee shall pay to the State out of any funds that may come into the trustee's possession as trustee, a sum equal to any penalties imposed pursuant to section 428-1302. Up until the time a trustee is appointed by the circuit court, or indefinitely if a trustee is not appointed by the circuit court, the last managers of the limited liability company if the company was manager-managed, or if not manager-managed the last members of the limited liability company, shall be and act as trustees for the creditors and members of the limited liability company with full powers to settle its affairs.
