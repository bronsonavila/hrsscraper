<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiff was not an owner of the Haina Mill property nor was plaintiff an owner of any other property or assets of the limited liability companies, plaintiff lacked standing to pursue certain amended counts because each claim sought to recover losses by, or other damages to, the limited liability companies, and the claims did not assert that plaintiff, as an individual, suffered an injury in fact as a result of defendants' allegedly wrongful actions. Whether further amendment of certain counts would still be futile even after plaintiff added allegations regarding harm to plaintiff's distributional interests, discussed. 23 F. Supp. 3d 1152 (2014).</p>
