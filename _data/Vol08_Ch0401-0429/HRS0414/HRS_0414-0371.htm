<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง414-371 Court action.</b> (a) If a demand for payment under section 414-359 remains unsettled, the corporation shall commence a proceeding within sixty days after receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If the corporation does not commence the proceeding within the sixty-day period, it shall pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The corporation shall commence the proceeding in the circuit court. If the corporation is a foreign corporation, it shall commence the proceeding in the county in this State where the principal office of the domestic corporation merged with or whose shares were acquired by the foreign corporation was located or, if the domestic corporation did not have its principal office in this State at the time of the transaction, then in the city and county of Honolulu.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The corporation shall make all dissenters (whether or not residents of this State) whose demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding as in an action against their shares and all parties must be served with a copy of the petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (b) is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the powers described in the order appointing them, or in any amendment to it. The dissenters are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) For the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter's shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) For the fair value, plus accrued interest, of the dissenter's after-acquired shares for which the corporation elected to withhold payment under section 414-358. [L 2000, c 244, pt of ยง1; am L 2009, c 55, ยง8]</p>
