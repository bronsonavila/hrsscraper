<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The determination shall be made:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) If there are two or more disinterested directors, by the board of directors by a majority vote of all the disinterested directors (a majority of whom for this purpose shall constitute a quorum), or by a majority of the members of a committee of two or more disinterested directors appointed by such a vote;</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Authorization of indemnification shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is permissible, except that if there are fewer than two disinterested directors or if the determination is made by special legal counsel, authorization of indemnification shall be made by those entitled under subsection (b)(2)(B) to select special legal counsel.
