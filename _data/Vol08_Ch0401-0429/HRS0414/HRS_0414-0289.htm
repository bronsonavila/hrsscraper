<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง414-289] Effect of amendment.</b> An amendment to articles of incorporation does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of the corporation, a proceeding to which the corporation is a party, or the existing rights of persons other than shareholders of the corporation. An amendment changing a corporation's name does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the corporation in its former name. [L 2000, c 244, pt of ยง1]</p>
