<p class="XNotes"> The statute of limitations for plaintiff's claim for trade secret misappropriation was not tolled by the doctrine of fraudulent concealment or equitable estoppel. 92 F. Supp. 3d 982 (2015).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trade secret misappropriation claim was time barred; the limitations period began upon plaintiff's suspicion of wrongdoing in the summer of 2008, notwithstanding whether plaintiff decided to conduct further investigation at that time. Thus, the statute of limitations expired in the summer of 2011. 92 F. Supp. 3d 982 (2015).</p>
