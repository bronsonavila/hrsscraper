<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection.

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) For the purposes [of] subsection (a)(1):</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation.</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The security interest in proceeds is perfected;</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) The proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) In the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral, or an account relating to the collateral.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), if a security interest in chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests in proceeds of the collateral rank according to priority in time of filing.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Subsection (d) applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) Subsections (a) through (e) are subject to:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Subsection (g) and the other provisions of this part;</p>
