<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง490:9-506 Effect of errors or omissions.</b> (a) A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this part is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 490:9-503(a) is seriously misleading.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 490:9-503(a), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) For purposes of section 490:9-508(b), the "debtor's correct name" in subsection (c) means the correct name of the new debtor. [L 2000, c 241, pt of ยง1]</p>
