<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Except as provided in subsection (c), an alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration unless that party assents to or is precluded from asserting the alteration. No other alteration discharges a party, and the instrument may be enforced according to its original terms.</p>
