<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The transferee in the disposition is the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of proceeds that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) A secured party that receives cash proceeds of a disposition in good faith and without knowledge that the receipt violates the rights of the holder of a security interest or other lien that is not subordinate to the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made:</p>
