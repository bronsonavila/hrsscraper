<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide that it is a security governed by this article, or it is an investment company security. However, an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this article and not by article 3, even though it also meets the requirements of that article. However, a negotiable instrument governed by article 3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.</p>
