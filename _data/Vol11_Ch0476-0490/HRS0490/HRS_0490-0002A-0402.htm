<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) For a commercially reasonable time, await retraction of repudiation and performance by the repudiating party;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Make demand pursuant to section 490:2A-401 and await assurance of future performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Resort to any right or remedy upon default under the lease contract or this article, even though the aggrieved party has notified the repudiating party that the aggrieved party would await the repudiating party's performance and assurance and has urged retraction. In addition, whether or not the aggrieved party is pursuing one of the foregoing remedies, the aggrieved party may suspend performance or, if the aggrieved party is the lessor, proceed in accordance with the provisions of this article on the lessor's right to identify goods to the lease contract notwithstanding default or to salvage unfinished goods (section 490:2A-524).
