<p class="1Paragraph"> (a) An offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (b) An order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods, but such a shipment of nonconforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (2) Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance. [L 1965, c 208, ยง2-206; HRS ยง490:2-206]</p>
