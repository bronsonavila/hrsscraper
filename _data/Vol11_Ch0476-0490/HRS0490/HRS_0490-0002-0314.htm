<p class="XNotes"> Hawaii courts have not adopted the custom product exception, and the court believed it would be inappropriate to consider it; even if the court were to consider it, the exception did not apply.

Supp. 2d 1017 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where product is defective, even when seller does not detect defect, seller is liable under implied warranty of merchantability. 66 H. 237, 659 P.2d 734.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> "Unfitness" in products liability actions in implied warranty compared to "defectiveness" in strict products liability actions in tort; neither tort nor warranty formulations of test for product defectiveness require that product actually malfunction. 74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.</p>
