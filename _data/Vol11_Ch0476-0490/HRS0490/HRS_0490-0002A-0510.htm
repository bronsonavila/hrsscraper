<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง490:2A-510 Installment lease contracts: rejection and default.</b> (a) Under an installment lease contract a lessee may reject any delivery that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that delivery and cannot be cured or the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (b) and the lessor or the supplier gives adequate assurance of its cure, the lessee must accept that delivery.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more deliveries substantially impairs the value of the installment lease contract as a whole there is a default with respect to the whole. But, the aggrieved party reinstates the installment lease contract as a whole if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming delivery without seasonably notifying of cancellation or brings an action with respect only to past deliveries or demands performance as to future deliveries.
