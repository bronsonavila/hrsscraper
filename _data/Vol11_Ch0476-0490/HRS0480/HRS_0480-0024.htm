<p class="XNotes"> Relation back of counterclaim to date of complaint. 473 F. Supp. 1296.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs may recover for §480-2 violations which occurred prior to four-year statute of limitations if they can prove fraudulent concealment; series of fly-drive arrangements constituted alleged continuing violation; section did not bar claims for fly-drives occurring less than four years prior to filing of action. 491 F. Supp. 1199.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> If State proved a continuing violation, it would be entitled to seek provable damages for the entire period of the continuing violation; this could include damages that might have occurred prior to the four years before suit was filed, if the continuing violation occurred during that period. 168 F. Supp. 2d 1180.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff's claim under §480-2 failed, where the statute of limitations barred any unlawful business practice claim that occurred prior to the four-year limitation period and although the additional alleged occurrences would not be time-barred, plaintiff's asserted damages flowing from the violation were unrecoverable because they were speculative. 522 F. Supp. 2d 1272.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Fraudulent concealment may toll this section's statute of limitations. 777 F. Supp. 2d 1224 (2011).</p>
