<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง481F-5] Express warranties.</b> (a) Notwithstanding any provision in any other law to the contrary, whenever the seller of print multiples furnishes a purchaser informational details required by section 481F-4, such information shall be presumed to be part of the basis of the bargain and shall create an express warranty as to the information furnished. </p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The express warranty shall not be negated or limited because the seller did not have a specific intention or authorization to make a warranty or because any information furnished to the purchaser purports to be merely the seller's opinion. </p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The existence of a factual basis for the information furnished to the purchaser shall not be a defense against the purchaser in an action to enforce the express warranty. [L 1986, c 194, pt of ยง2]</p>
