<p class="XNotes"> Trial court correctly applied the discretionary language of ยง481C-1 in ruling that plaintiff roofing contractor did not "solicit" homeowner to purchase new roof, so as to bring the transaction under the provisions of this chapter where homeowner approached contractor at a home show and requested a home visit to discuss the suitability and cost of a new roof, contacted the contractor on another occasion and visited the company's warehouse prior to the start of work, and contractor visited home several times to discuss the project with homeowner. 110 H. 248, 131 P.3d 1230.</p>
