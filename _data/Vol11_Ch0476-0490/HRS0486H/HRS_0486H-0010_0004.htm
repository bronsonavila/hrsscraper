<p class="XNotes"> The "substantially advances" formula announced in Agins v. City of Tiburon is not a valid method of identifying regulatory takings for which the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation. Since oil company claiming that the rent cap provision of Act 257 [L 1997 (§486H-10.4(c))], on its face, effected a taking of its property argued only a "substantially advances" theory in support of its takings claim, it was not entitled to summary judgment on that claim. 544 U.S. 528.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> In an action to recover payments which plaintiffs claimed exceeded the amount permissible under this section, defendants' motion for summary judgment granted, as there was no lease renewal. 460 F. Supp. 2d 1215.</p>
