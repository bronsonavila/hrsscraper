<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> (i) The zone price adjustments for zones 2 through 8, set forth in subsection (g), shall be divided as follows:</p>

Any person who refuses or fails to comply with a request for information by the commission shall be subject to a fine of up to $50,000 per day. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> (k) The maximum pre-tax wholesale gasoline price imposed by this section shall take effect on September 1, 2005, notwithstanding the lack of the adoption of rules pursuant to this section; provided that notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the maximum pre-tax wholesale price under this section shall be suspended indefinitely upon the effective date of Act 78, Session Laws of Hawaii 2006, and shall not thereafter become effective until and unless the governor publishes a notice statewide in accordance with section 1-28.5 that the reinstatement of the maximum pre-tax wholesale price under this section is beneficial to the economic well-being, health, and safety of the people of the State. The maximum pre-tax wholesale price shall become effective five days after the publication of the notice by the governor unless otherwise specified by the governor, and shall remain in effect for thirty days, after which time it shall be automatically suspended. Thereafter, the governor may reinstate the maximum pre-tax wholesale price for thirty-day periods on the same conditions as set forth above. Upon a finding that the maximum pre-tax wholesale price would impose a financial hardship upon a distributor within a zone, the governor, in the governor's discretion, may increase the maximum pre-tax wholesale price for the zone in an amount determined necessary to eliminate the financial hardship on any affected distributor who does not operate a refinery within the State. Any increase in the maximum pre-tax wholesale price shall be included in the notice published by the governor.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> (l) The suspension of the maximum pre-tax wholesale gasoline price shall suspend the commission's duty to calculate and publish the maximum pre-tax wholesale gasoline price that would have been in effect but for the suspension, but shall not suspend or affect:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph" style="line-height:normal"> (1) Any duty to register, timely provide information, make a report, or file a statement under chapter 486J; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph" style="line-height:normal"> (2) Any duty of the commission to enforce chapter 486B.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> (m) Any manufacturer, wholesaler, or jobber who knowingly violates any requirement imposed or rule adopted under this section, except for subsection (j), shall be subject to a civil penalty, for each violation, equal to three times the amount of the overcharge or $250,000, whichever is greater, and shall be liable for the costs of the action and reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court. Within two years from the date the commission obtains actual knowledge of the violation, the commission may institute a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction to collect the civil penalty, the costs, and attorney's fees. In the case of ongoing violation, the two-year period shall start from the date of the last violation. The commission may refer any such action to the attorney general as it deems appropriate. As used in this subsection, "overcharge" means the number of gallons of gasoline sold, times the wholesale price at which the manufacturer or jobber sold regular unleaded, mid-grade, or premium gasoline to a dealer retail station, an independent retail station, or another jobber or wholesaler, less taxes assessed, less the maximum pre-tax wholesale gasoline price established pursuant to subsection (b).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> (n) The department of business, economic development, and tourism shall have the power to determine the extent to which a manufacturer, wholesaler, or jobber is complying with any requirement imposed or rule adopted under this section, including the power to compel a manufacturer, wholesaler, or jobber to submit documents, data, and information necessary and appropriate for the department of business, economic development, and tourism to determine compliance.</p>
