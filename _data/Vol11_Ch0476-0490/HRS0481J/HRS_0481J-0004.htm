The term "known" encompasses knowledge obtained through an inspection, from a previous owner, from the salesperson at an auction or another dealer, or through other means.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Material mechanical defect" means any defect or malfunction which renders the motor vehicle mechanically unsound or inoperable. [L 1994, c 224, pt of ยง1]</p>
