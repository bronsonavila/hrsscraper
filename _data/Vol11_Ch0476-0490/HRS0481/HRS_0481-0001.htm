<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Motion picture films when delivered under a lease to motion picture houses shall not be deemed to be a commodity or product of general use, or consumption, under this part. This part shall not be construed to prohibit the meeting in good faith of the rates of a competitor as herein defined, selling the same article or product, or service or output of a service trade in the same locality or trade area, or to prevent a reasonable classification of service by public utilities for the purpose of establishing rates.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The inhibition hereof against locality discrimination embraces any scheme of special rebates, collateral contracts, or any device of any nature whereby such discrimination is, in substance or fact, effected in violation of the spirit and intent of this part.
