<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Any person who infringes a right granted by this chapter shall be liable for the greater of $10,000 or the actual damages sustained as a result of the infringement, and any profits that are attributable to the infringement and not taken into account when calculating actual damages; provided that each search of an individual's name on an internet search engine shall be exempt from the statutory damages identified in this subsection.

For the purposes of computing statutory damages, the use of a name, voice, signature, or likeness constitutes a single act of infringement regardless of the number of copies made or the number of times the name, voice, signature, or likeness is displayed.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) At any time while an action under this chapter is pending, the court may, pursuant to rule 65 of the Hawaii rules of civil procedure, order the impounding, on reasonable terms, of all materials or any part thereof claimed to have been made or used in violation of the injured party's rights, and the court may enjoin the use of all plates, molds, matrices, masters, tapes, film negatives, master recordings, copies of recordings, optical disk stampers, or other articles by means of which these materials may be reproduced.</p>
