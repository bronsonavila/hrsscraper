<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[§486K-5.5] Hotelkeeper's liability limited for certain beach and ocean activities.</b> In a claim alleging injury or loss on account of a hazardous condition on a beach or in the ocean, a hotelkeeper shall be liable to a hotel guest for damages for personal injury, death, property damage, or other loss resulting from the hotel guest going onto the beach or into the ocean for a recreational purpose, including wading, swimming, surfing, body surfing, boogie boarding, diving, or snorkeling, only when such loss or injury is caused by the hotelkeeper's failure to warn against a hazardous condition on a beach or in the ocean, known, or which should have been known to a reasonably prudent hotelkeeper, and when the hazardous condition is not known to the guest or would not have been known to a reasonably prudent guest. A hotelkeeper owes no duty and shall have no liability for conditions which were not created by the hotel to a person who is not a guest of the hotel for injury or damage resulting from any beach or ocean activity.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> As used in this section, "beach" means the beach fronting the hotel, and "hotel guest" means a guest of that particular hotel and other persons occupying the assigned rooms. [L 1994, c 90, §2]</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's motion for summary judgment denied, where, inter alia, (1) defendant's hotel did not "front" the beach within the meaning of this statute because it was not contiguous with the beach; thus, defendant not protected by the limitations on liability contained in this statute; and (2) court not persuaded by defendant's argument that this statute abrogated the liability of all hotelkeepers for ocean-related injuries. 98 F. Supp. 2d 1129.</p>
