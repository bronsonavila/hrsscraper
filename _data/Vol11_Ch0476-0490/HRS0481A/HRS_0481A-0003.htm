<p class="XNotes"> Where complaints alleged that credit card providers violated this section and §§480-2 and 480-13.5 and unjust enrichment, the claims were not preempted by the National Bank Act. Also, because the complaints unambiguously disclaimed class status, the actions could not be removed under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. 761 F.3d 1027 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs' unfair or deceptive acts and practices claim, in violation of this section, based on the recording of an allegedly false assignment failed where plaintiffs failed to establish that the assignment was false; moreover, contrary to plaintiffs' contention, the express terms of the mortgage and the assignment in question suggest that one named defendant only transferred to other named defendant its "'right to foreclose and sell the [p]roperty'". 823 F. Supp. 2d 1061 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> No "likelihood of confusion" found. 399 F. Supp. 604; 5 H. App. 194, 683 P.2d 1220.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff's likelihood of confusion allegations may support both §§480-2 unfair methods of competition and 481A [sic] deceptive acts or practices claims. 945 F. Supp. 1344.</p>
