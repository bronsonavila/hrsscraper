<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Issue an order under section 485A-204.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) An order under subsection (a) shall be<b> </b>effective on the date of issuance. Upon issuance of the order, the commissioner shall promptly serve each person subject to the order with a copy of the order. The order shall include a statement of any civil penalty or costs of investigation the commissioner will seek, a statement of the reasons for the order, and notice that, within fifteen days after receipt of a request in a record from the person, the matter shall be scheduled for a hearing in accordance with chapter 91.

If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until a final determination is<b> </b>made. During the pendency of any hearing requested under this subsection, the cease and desist order shall remain in effect unless vacated or modified by the commissioner; provided that any penalty shall not take effect until the final order is issued.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If a hearing is requested or ordered pursuant to subsection (b), a hearing shall be held pursuant to chapter 91.

The order so filed has the same effect as a judgment of the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of the court.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) If a person does not comply with an order under this section, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order. If the court finds, after service and opportunity for hearing, that the person was not in compliance with the commissioner's order, the court may find the person in civil contempt of the order. The court may impose a further civil penalty against the person for contempt in an amount not to exceed $2,000 for each violation and may grant any other relief the court determines is just and proper in the circumstances.
