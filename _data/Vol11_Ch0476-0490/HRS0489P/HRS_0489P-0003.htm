A consumer credit reporting agency shall not charge a victim of identity theft a fee for placing, lifting, or removing a security freeze on a credit report but may charge any other consumer a fee not to exceed $5 for each request by the consumer to place, lift, or remove a security freeze from the consumer's credit report.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> A consumer who is a resident of this State and has been the victim of identity theft may place a security freeze on the consumer's credit report by making a request in writing by certified mail to a consumer credit reporting agency, at an address designated by the agency to receive such requests, with a valid copy of a police report, investigative report, or complaint the consumer has filed with a law enforcement agency about unlawful use of the consumer's personal information by another person. A consumer who has not been the victim of identity theft may place a security freeze on the consumer's credit report by making a request in writing by certified mail to a consumer credit reporting agency.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> A security freeze shall prohibit the consumer credit reporting agency from releasing the consumer's credit report or any information from it without the express authorization of the consumer. This subsection shall not prevent a consumer credit reporting agency from advising a third party that a security freeze is in effect with respect to the consumer's credit report.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) A consumer reporting agency shall place a security freeze on a consumer's credit report no later than five business days after receiving a written request from the consumer.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The consumer reporting agency shall send a written confirmation of the security freeze to the consumer within ten business days of placing the security freeze and shall provide the consumer with a unique personal identification number or password, other than the consumer's social security number, to be used by the consumer when providing authorization for the release of the consumer's credit report for a specific party, parties, or period of time.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) If the consumer wishes to allow access to the consumer's credit report for a specific party, parties, or period of time while a freeze is in place, the consumer shall contact the consumer reporting agency at a point of contact designated by the agency using the procedures that may be developed by the consumer reporting agency, request that the freeze be temporarily lifted, and provide the following:</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Upon consumer request; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) When the consumer's credit report was frozen due to a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">If a consumer reporting agency intends to remove a freeze upon a consumer's credit report pursuant to this subsection, the consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer in writing prior to removing the freeze on the consumer's credit report.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (h) If a third party requests access to a credit report on which a security freeze is in effect and this request is in connection with an application for credit or any other use and the consumer does not allow the consumer's credit report to be accessed by that specific party or for that period of time, the third party may treat the application as incomplete.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (i) If a consumer requests a security freeze, the consumer reporting agency shall disclose to the consumer the process of placing and temporarily lifting a security freeze and the process for allowing access to information from the consumer's credit report for a specific party, parties, or period of time while the security freeze is in place.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (j) A security freeze shall remain in place until the consumer requests that the security freeze be removed. A consumer reporting agency shall remove a security freeze within three business days of receiving a request for removal at a point of contact designated by the agency using procedures that may be developed by the consumer reporting agency; provided that the consumer shall provide the following:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Clear and proper identification; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The unique personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency pursuant to subsection (c).</p>
