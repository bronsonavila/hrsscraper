<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The application shall be signed and verified by the applicant, a member of the firm, or an officer of the corporation or association applying. The application shall be accompanied by one specimen per class of goods or services showing the mark as actually used on or in connection with such goods or services and the application fee payable to the director.
