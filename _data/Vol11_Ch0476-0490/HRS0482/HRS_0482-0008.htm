The petition shall set forth the facts and authority supporting the claim that the petitioner's registered trade name or entity name is substantially identical to the subsequently registered trade name, the petitioner's trade name or entity name was registered before the subsequently registered trade name, and the registration of the subsequently registered trade name should be revoked.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> The Hawaii Uniform Trade Secrets Act preempts non-contract civil claims based upon the alleged acquisition, disclosure, or use of confidential information that does not rise to the level of a statutorily-defined trade secret. 123 H. 314, 235 P.3d 310 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> To the extent that a claim is "based upon wrongful conduct, independent of the misappropriation of trade secrets", it will not be preempted by the Hawaii Uniform Trade Secrets Act. 123 H. 314, 235 P.3d 310 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> When tort, restitutionary, and other laws of this State conflict with the Hawaii Uniform Trade Secrets Act, they are preempted to the extent that they are based upon misappropriation of a trade secret; that is, if proof of a non-Hawaii Uniform Trade Secrets Act claim would also simultaneously establish a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, it is preempted irrespective of whatever surplus elements of proof were necessary to establish it. 123 H. 314, 235 P.3d 310 (2010).</p>
