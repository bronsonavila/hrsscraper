<p class="XNotes"> Defendant's argument that a crime victim who received indemnification from an insurer did not suffer a "loss" within the meaning of §706-646 was without merit; the only exception for or reduction of restitution plainly stated in §706-646 is that any amount actually recovered by the victim from the criminal should be deducted from the amount the victim might recover from the crime victim compensation special fund pursuant to this section. 121 H. 135 (App.), 214 P.3d 1125 (2009).</p>
