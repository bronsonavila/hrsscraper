<p class="XNotes"> Inasmuch as the protections of the infancy doctrine have been incorporated into the statutory scheme of Hawaii's child labor law, the general rule that contracts entered into by minors are voidable is not applicable in the employment context; thus, trial court properly rejected plaintiff's argument that plaintiff was entitled to disaffirm plaintiff's employment contract, including the arbitration provision, by reason of plaintiff's minority status. 110 H. 520, 135 P.3d 129 (2006).</p>
