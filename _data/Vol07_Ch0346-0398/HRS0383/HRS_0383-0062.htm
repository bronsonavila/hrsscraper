If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one employer and one or more of such employers are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount payable to the fund by each employer that is liable for such payments shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) or paragraph (2).</p>

Upon its approval of the application, the department shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the department receives the application, and it shall notify the group's representative of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than two years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the department or upon application by the group. The director of labor and industrial relations shall prescribe such regulations as the director deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this paragraph, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this paragraph by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) When a nonprofit organization terminates its self-financing status and elects to pay contributions under this chapter, any remaining amount of positive reserve balance in its self-financing account will be transferred to its contributory reserve account. The department shall determine the contribution rate of such employer in accordance with provisions of section [383-66(a)(2)].
