Any individual claiming benefits in any proceeding before the department or the referee may be represented by counsel or other duly authorized agent, but no such counsel or agent shall either charge or receive for such services more than an amount approved by the department or referee, and such amount shall in no case exceed ten per cent of the sum of the average benefit duration for the prior calendar year as computed by the department of labor and industrial relations multiplied by the claimant's weekly benefit amount, payable as a result of such proceeding. For the purposes of this section, the term "average benefit duration" shall mean the average actual duration of benefits computed by dividing the total number of weeks compensated during a year by the corresponding number of first payments made during the year.</p>
