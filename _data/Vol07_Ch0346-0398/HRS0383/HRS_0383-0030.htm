<p class="XNotes"> "Stoppage of work" means substantial curtailment of business activities at employer's establishment, rather than unemployment of striking employee; "establishment," construed. 53 H. 185, 489 P.2d 1397 (1971).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> After many counseling sessions and notices regarding employee's poor dependability, employee should have known job would be in jeopardy if employee left work early without permission; employee's conscious decision to do so constituted an unexcused absence which demonstrated a "wilful or wanton disregard of the employer's interests" and disqualified employee for unemployment benefits. 84 H. 305, 933 P.2d 1339 (1997).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Employee did not voluntarily quit employment but was discharged where employer was moving party in termination of employment relationship. 84 H. 305, 933 P.2d 1339 (1997).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The intent of unemployment benefits under this section is to pay benefits only to those claimants who became involuntarily unemployed through no fault of their own; where claimant's conduct constituted misconduct connected with work, as found by the appeals officer and the trial court, claimant's misconduct connected with work disqualified claimant from receiving unemployment benefits under paragraph (2). 108 H. 258, 118 P.3d 1201 (2005).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where there was a "substantial curtailment" of employer bus company's business activity during the strike, there was a "stoppage of work"; as the stoppage of work came about "because of a labor dispute", there was a "stoppage of work" within the meaning of paragraph (4) and employees were not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits. 110 H. 259, 132 P.3d 368 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Employee has burden of proving that a voluntary termination was with good cause; employee has duty to try reasonable alternatives for solution of problem within employer's organization before terminating employment. 2 H. App. 560, 634 P.2d 1058 (1981).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> "Constructive voluntary leaving" doctrine cannot be basis for disqualification from unemployment benefits under paragraph (1). 84 H. 407 (App.), 935 P.2d 122 (1997).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> For employee to be the "moving party in the termination of the employment relationship" and to therefore have "left work voluntarily", the facts and circumstances must indicate that employee had the intent to terminate the employment relationship. 84 H. 407 (App.), 935 P.2d 122 (1997).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where claimant knew or should have known that claimant's job would be in jeopardy if claimant chose to drive uninsured, and claimant made a conscious decision in the face of that risk to do precisely that, demonstrating a "wilful or wanton disregard of employer's interests", defined by Hawaii administrative rule §12-5-51(c) as "misconduct connected with work", this disqualified claimant from unemployment insurance benefits under paragraph (2). 93 H. 75 (App.), 996 P.2d 280 (2000).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Construing §383-29 and this section together, in order to requalify for unemployment insurance benefits after a voluntary separation without good cause, an individual must work for a subsequent employer who is subject to this chapter and be paid wages from the subsequent employer in an amount sufficient to meet the requalification earnings threshold. 94 H. 262 (App.), 12 P.3d 362 (2000).</p>
