<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§383-167 Amendment or repeal of federal law, effect of; nonconformity, effect of.</b> If at any time the governor finds that the federal Unemployment Tax Act has been amended or repealed by act of Congress, with the result that no portion of the contributions required by this chapter may be credited against the tax under the federal Unemployment Tax Act, the governor shall publicly so proclaim and upon the date of such proclamation this chapter requiring the payment of contributions and benefits shall be suspended. The department of labor and industrial relations shall thereupon requisition from the unemployment trust fund all moneys therein standing to the credit of the State and shall direct the director of finance to deposit such moneys, together with any other moneys in the fund, as a special fund in any banks or public depositaries in the State in which general funds of the State may be deposited. Such moneys shall after six months be refunded to the employers who have made contributions under this chapter, on the following basis: each employer shall be entitled to the total of the contributions paid by the employer less the total of benefits charged to the employer's account pursuant to sections 383-63 to 383-69, and if there are not sufficient moneys to pay all expenses and to pay to all the employers the amounts to which they are respectively entitled, then the amounts which the employers shall receive shall be reduced proportionately. If after the payment of all expenses and the payment to the employers of the amounts to which they are entitled there are any moneys undisposed of, the same shall be held for disposition as the legislature may prescribe.</p>
