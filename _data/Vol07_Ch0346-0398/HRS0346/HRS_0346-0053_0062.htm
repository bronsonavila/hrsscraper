Not more than one month following the beginning of each calendar quarter and based on the receipt of federally qualified health center or rural health clinic submitted claims during the prior calendar quarter, federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics shall receive the difference between the combination of payments the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic receives from estimated supplemental quarterly payments and payments received from medicaid managed care organizations and payments the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic would have received under the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 prospective payment system methodology. Balances due from the federally qualified health center shall be recouped from the next quarter's estimated supplemental payment.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The federally qualified health center or rural health clinic shall file an annual settlement report summarizing patient encounters within one hundred fifty days following the end of a calendar year in which supplemental payments are received from the department. The total amount of supplemental and medicaid managed care organization payments received by the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic shall be reviewed against the amount that the actual number of visits provided under the federally qualified health center's or rural health clinic's contract with the medicaid managed care organization would have yielded under the prospective payment system. The department shall also receive financial records from the medicaid managed care organization. As part of this review, the department may request additional documentation from the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic and the medicaid managed care organization to resolve differences between medicaid managed care organization and provider records. Upon conclusion of the review, the department shall calculate a final payment that is due to or from the participating federally qualified health center or rural health clinic. The department shall notify the participating federally qualified health center or rural health clinic of the balance due to or from the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic. The notice of program reimbursement shall include the department's calculation of the balance due to or from the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span class="aSubsectionChar"> (c) For the purposes of this section, the payments received from medicaid managed care organizations exclude payments for non-prospective payment system services, managed care risk pool accruals, distributions, or losses, or any pay-for-performance bonuses or other forms of incentive payments such as quality improvement recognition grants and awards.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) An alternative supplemental managed care payment methodology other than the one set forth herein may be implemented as long as the alternative payment methodology is consented to in writing by the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic to which the methodology applies.
