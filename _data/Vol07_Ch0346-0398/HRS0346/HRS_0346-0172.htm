<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง346-172] Rules for registration.</b> (a) The department shall adopt rules establishing minimum requirements to ensure the health and safety of children provided care in a family child care home.

<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Protection of children who are provided care from abuse.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) It is the intent of the legislature that the:</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Minimum requirements be as simple and clear as possible;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Minimum requirements be germane to the provision of care to children in a private home as opposed to a nonresidential facility or institution, require as little recordkeeping by the provider as possible, and require information and reports if deemed necessary, from the provider which the department intends to scrutinize carefully and not cursorily; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Department establish minimum requirements, the compliance with which can be assessed easily and objectively by officers and employees of the department, providers, and parents and legal guardians of children. [L 1985, c 208, pt of ยง2]</p>
