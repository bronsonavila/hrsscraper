<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§371-4</b> <b>Labor and industrial relations appeals board.</b> (a) There is created a labor and industrial relations appeals board composed of three members nominated and, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, appointed by the governor for terms of ten years each, except that the terms of members first appointed shall be for six, eight, and ten years respectively as designated by the governor at the time of appointments. The governor shall designate the chairperson of the board, who shall be an attorney at law licensed to practice in all of the courts of this State. Each member shall hold office until the member's successor is appointed and qualified. Because cumulative experience and continuity in office are essential to the proper handling of appeals under workers' compensation law and other labor laws, it is hereby declared to be in the public interest to continue board members in office as long as efficiency is demonstrated. The members shall devote full time to their duties as members of the board. Effective July 1, 2005, the chairperson of the board shall be paid a salary set at eighty-seven per cent of the salary of the director of labor and industrial relations, and the salary of each of the other members shall be ninety-five per cent of the chairperson's salary.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The board shall have power to decide appeals from decisions and orders of the director of labor and industrial relations issued under the workers' compensation law and any other law for which an appeal to the board is provided by law.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) For purposes of appeals to the board conducted pursuant to chapter 91, notwithstanding section 91-9.5, all parties shall be given written notice of hearing by first class mail at least fifteen days before the hearing.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Unless otherwise provided by law, if service by first class mail is not made because the board or its agents have been unable to ascertain the address of the party after reasonable and diligent inquiry, the notice of hearing may be given to the party by online posting on the board's webpage or by publication at least once in each of two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation. The online posting or last published notice shall appear at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing. The online posting shall be removed from the webpage no less than five business days after the date of the hearing.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) A decision concurred in by any two members shall constitute a decision of the board.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) A vacancy in the board, if there remain two members of it, shall not impair the authority of two members to act.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) If any member of the board is unable to act because of absence, temporary disability, or disqualification, the governor may make a temporary appointment and the appointee shall have all the powers and duties of a regular member of the board.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (h) The chairperson of the appeal board shall be responsible for the administrative functions of the appeal board. The appeal board may:</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Set the duties and compensation of the executive officer, hearings officer, and employees; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Provide for the reimbursement of actual and necessary expenses incurred by the executive officer, hearings officer, and employees in the performance of their duties, within the amounts made available by appropriations therefor.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Members of the appeal board and employees other than clerical and stenographic employees shall be exempt from chapters 76 and 89. Clerical and stenographic employees shall be employed in accordance with chapter 76.</p>

The board may after notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard by the board:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Impose administrative sanctions; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Impose monetary sanctions of not more than $250 for each offense against any person who is found to have violated the board's rules or orders, which amounts shall be deposited into the special compensation fund created by section 386-151.</p>
