<p class="XNotes"> Employee's claims for breach of contract and fiduciary duty, alleging employer's failure to notify employee of conversion rights from group to individual health insurance policy, preempted by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. 768 F. Supp. 734 (1991).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> District court concluded, for purposes of plaintiffs' motion to remand to state court only, that: (1) some of plaintiffs' allegations in counts II (violations of chapter 480) and III (breach of fiduciary duty) of the complaint were expressly preempted by ERISA pursuant to 29 U.S.C. §1144(a) and were not subject to the exception for this chapter, and (2) therefore, those claims were necessarily federal in nature, and defendants' removal of the action based on federal question jurisdiction was proper. 892 F. Supp. 2d 1288 (2012).</p>
