<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (i) The appeals board may affirm, modify, or vacate the citation, the abatement requirement therein, or the proposed penalty or order or continue the matter upon terms and conditions as may be deemed necessary, or remand the case to the director with instructions for further proceedings, or direct other relief as may be appropriate.</p>
