<p class="XNotes"> Individuals are subject to liability under §378-2 when they act as agents of an employer. 396 F. Supp. 2d 1138 (2005).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Based on the plain language of this section and §378-2(2), plaintiff may not proceed under §378-2(2) against defendant, an individual employee. 405 F. Supp. 2d 1225 (2005).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The Hawaii supreme court in French did not demonstrate a clear attempt to keep Hawaii law distinct from the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) such that a claim under the Hawaii discrimination law raises issues sufficiently distinct from an ADA claim so as to prevent application of the first-to-file-rule. 728 F. Supp. 2d 1096 (2010).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Based on the definition of "employer" in this section, legislature intended all employers, regardless of size, to be subject to the provisions of this chapter. 89 H. 269, 971 P.2d 1104 (1999).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The issue of whether a plaintiff's major life activity is substantially limited must be resolved on a case-by-case basis; thus, the determination of whether the lifting restriction on employee was substantial required an individualized inquiry that was inappropriate for summary judgment. 105 H. 462, 99 P.3d 1046 (2004).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Individual employees are not personally liable as "employers" for harassment and retaliation claims under §378-2(1)(A) and (2); by using the term "agent" in the definition of "employer", the legislature did nothing more than ensure that employers would be liable for the discriminatory conduct of their agents. 133 H. 332, 328 P.3d 341 (2014).</p>
