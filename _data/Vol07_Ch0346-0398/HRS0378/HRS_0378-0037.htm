<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง378-37 Enforcement of order; judgment rendered thereon.</b> If an employer fails or neglects to comply with the final order of the department of labor and industrial relations from which no appeal has been taken as provided by this part, the department or the employee affected may apply to the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the employer resides or transacts business for a judgment to enforce the provisions of the final order and for any other appropriate relief. In any proceeding to enforce the provisions of the final order, the department or the employee affected need only file with the court proof that notice of the hearing was given, a certified copy of the final order, and proof that the final order was served. The judgment shall have the same effect, and all proceedings in relation thereto shall thereafter be the same, as though the judgment had been rendered in an action duly heard and determined by the court.
