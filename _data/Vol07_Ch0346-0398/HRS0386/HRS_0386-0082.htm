<p class="XNotes"> In order to identify the "date of injury" required by the department of labor and industrial relations in connection with the filing of a workers' compensation claim under this section, a claimant in a case arising under the "injury-by-disease" prong of §386-3 may rely upon the last day of employment as the "date of disability", but this "date of disability" may also be the date of diagnosis of the disabling condition. 94 H. 70, 9 P.3d 382 (2000).</p>
