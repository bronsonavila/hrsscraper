<p class="XNotes"> An order regarding the award or denial of attorney's fees and costs with respect to subsection (b) is a final order under §91-14(a) for purposes of appeal; this final order rule applies prospectively to prevent injustice; subsection (b) allows assessment of attorney's fees and costs against an employer if the employer loses the final appeal. 104 H. 164, 86 P.3d 973 (2004).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where appeals court's opinion regarding attorney's fees and costs under this section was not ripe for decision, constituted an advisory opinion akin to the issuance of an opinion when there was no subject matter jurisdiction, and constituted inappropriate judicial interference with an administrative decision of an entity within a separate, co-equal branch that had not been formalized and had not yet affected the challenging parties in a concrete way, thereby implicating separation-of-powers concerns, the appeals court's exercise of appellate power constituted error. 121 H. 33, 211 P.3d 750 (2009).</p>
