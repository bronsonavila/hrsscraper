<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) Reimbursement of attorney's fees and costs of the party or parties defrauded.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) With respect to the administrative penalties set forth in subsection (e), no penalty shall be imposed except upon consideration of a written complaint that specifically alleges a violation of this section occurring within two years of the date of said complaint. A copy of the complaint specifying the alleged violation shall be served promptly upon the person charged. The director or board shall issue, where a penalty is ordered, a written decision stating all findings following a hearing held not fewer than twenty days after written notice to the person charged.

<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> A violation of this section, a fraudulent insurance act, must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. 113 H. 1, 147 P.3d 785 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> In the context of subsection (a), for a fraudulent insurance act to occur, the "logical result or purpose" of "acts or omissions" must be "to obtain benefits"; subsection (a) thus does not require that a party actually obtain benefits to be subject to a penalty, it only requires that obtaining benefits was the "logical result or purpose" of the party's acts or omissions. 113 H. 1, 147 P.3d 785 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Subsection (a)(8) does not require reliance or detrimental reliance by any party for a violation of its terms to occur. 113 H. 1, 147 P.3d 785 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where appellant was subjected to the administrative penalties set forth in subsection (e), and not criminal penalties, appellant's arguments that this section unconstitutionally delegates the State's police power to private parties by permitting such parties to file a complaint were unpersuasive. 113 H. 1, 147 P.3d 785 (2006).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where six out of seven factors weighed against concluding that the sanction of a fine under subsection (e) was punitive, appellant failed to provide the "clearest proof" that the administrative penalties imposed pursuant to subsection (e) were criminal and punitive, despite the legislature's expressed intent to the contrary. 113 H. 1, 147 P.3d 785 (2006).</p>
