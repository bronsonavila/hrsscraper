<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §373C-1 Findings</b>. The legislature finds that there is a need to coordinate the efforts of a variety of employment-related agencies, programs, and activities, for the purpose of strengthening employment, training, and educational planning and delivery of services. Promoting this coordination can be achieved best through the development of an occupational and career information planning base. A Hawaii occupational information system could meet the common needs of vocational education programs and employment and training programs if it contained data on occupational demand and supply based on uniform definitions, standardized estimating procedures, and common classification codes. This occupational information must be geared to the career decision-making process of youth, as well as to the administrative needs of educational and training planning. The delivery of career information is needed to improve the match of youth career desires with available and anticipated labor demand. [L 1983, c 193, pt of §1; am L 2001, c 171, §1]</p>
