<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Chapters 387 and 388 serve to prevent employer from withholding sums or benefits to which employee has rights by virtue of contract with employer, not a predecessor. 661 F.2d 776 (1981).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiff hotel employees' claim pursuant to this chapter was not preempted by §301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §185(a), because the claim asserted a state-law right that was independent of any right conferred by their collective bargaining agreement ("agreement"); further, agreement did not need to be interpreted in resolving this claim. 835 F. Supp. 2d 914 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Plaintiffs could not bring a statutory claim under this chapter, where plaintiffs sought to recover wages to which they failed to demonstrate they were legally entitled. Plaintiffs could not assert a legal right as third party beneficiaries to the amounts allegedly withheld by virtue of defendant employer's failure to pay the bargaining unit wage rates as set forth in the 2006 Addendum to defendant employer's contract and plaintiffs did not seek to recover withheld wages pursuant to a contractual agreement between plaintiffs and defendant employer. 105 F. Supp. 3d 1165 (2015).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant had authority over the operation of the hotels at which plaintiffs were employed, and defendant failed to raise an argument regarding defendant's status as "employer" until after the court had entered its final judgment, the circuit court did not err in concluding that defendant was an "employer" under this chapter. 133 H. 1, 323 P.3d 792 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Chapter establishes clear mandate of public policy to protect at will employee from being discharged for asserting rights accorded employee by its provisions, and does not itself provide sufficient remedy for discharge; no legislative intent to supersede at will employees common law remedy for wrongful discharge detected. 10 H. App. 250, 865 P.2d 170 (1994).</p>
