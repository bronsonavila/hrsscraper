<p class="XNotes"> Because defendant concedes that it is contractually responsible for managing the resorts that plaintiff employees have worked at and had the authority to do so, there was no genuine issue of fact that defendant "permit[ted] or suffer[ed]" plaintiffs to work, and was therefore their "employer" under this section. 810 F. Supp. 2d 1145 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> In reading §388-3 in the context of the entire statute and in light of the common law, the trial court did not err in concluding that payment for unused vacation upon separation from employment did not constitute "wages" under the plain meaning of this section. 108 H. 411, 121 P.3d 391 (2005).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where defendant had authority over the operation of the hotels at which plaintiffs were employed, and defendant failed to raise an argument regarding defendant's status as "employer" until after the court had entered its final judgment, the circuit court did not err in concluding that defendant was an "employer" under this chapter. 133 H. 1, 323 P.3d 792 (2014).</p>
