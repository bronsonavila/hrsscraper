<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> The legislative history of §481B-14, as interpreted by the Hawaii supreme court in Davis, allows plaintiff hotel employees to recover for unpaid service charges imposed without the requisite disclosure set forth in §481B-14, through a claim brought pursuant to §§388-6 and 388-11 and this section. 835 F. Supp. 2d 914 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"><b> </b>When a hotel or restaurant applying a service charge for the sale of food or beverage services allegedly violates §481B-14 by: (1) not distributing the full service charge directly to its employees as "tip income" (in other words, as "wages and tips of employees"); and (2) failing to disclose this practice to the purchaser of the services, the employees may bring an action under §§388-6 and 388-8 and this section to enforce the employees' rights and seek remedies. 130 H. 130, 306 P.3d 175 (2013).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> Where employers imposed a service charge at banquets and other functions held at employers' hotels, and retained a portion of the service charge income without disclosing that practice to customers, service employees were entitled to an award of double damages under this section. 133 H. 1, 323 P.3d 792 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where employers imposed a service charge at banquets and other functions held at employers' hotels, and retained a portion of the service charge income without disclosing that practice to customers, the circuit court correctly held that "tip income" retained by employers in violation of §481B-14 constitutes "compensation" earned by service employees for purposes of bringing a claim under this section and §§388-6 and 388-11. 133 H. 1, 323 P.3d 792 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Employer has burden of proving "equitable justification" for failure to pay wages; civil penalty justified. 5 H. App. 106, 679 P.2d 627 (1984).</p>
