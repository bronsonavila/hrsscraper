If the professional employer organization furnishes an irrevocable letter of credit approved by the director, the director shall be named as the beneficiary, and the irrevocable letter of credit shall be issued by a bank, savings bank, or other depository financial institution insured by a federal depository insurance agency and authorized to do business in the State. The requirements of this section shall be satisfied by a single bond or its irrevocable letter of credit equivalent. If a professional employer organization has more than one branch location, the bond or its irrevocable letter of credit equivalent shall cover all locations.</p>
