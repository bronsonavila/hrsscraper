<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §353-8 Conditional release centers for committed persons.</b> (a) The director may establish and operate facilities to be known as conditional release centers, either operated separately, or as part of community correctional centers.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The purpose of such facilities is to provide housing, meals, supervision, guidance, furloughs, and other correctional programs for persons committed to the department of public safety and to give committed persons, in selected cases, a chance to begin adjustment to life in a free society and to serve as a test of an individual's fitness for release on parole.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The department shall notify the county prosecutors and police chiefs whenever a person committed for an offense against the person as described in chapter 707, or any convicted felon, is admitted to a work furlough, conditional release, or similar program. Notification shall be transmitted in writing no later than thirty days prior to the commencement of the program and shall list the conditions pertaining thereto. For parole violators who are recommitted to prison for less than thirty days or who are placed on a work furlough, conditional release, or similar program, notification as described above shall be transmitted in writing on the next working day after recommitment or placement in a program.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Additionally, whenever the department admits a committed person who has been convicted of an offense against the person as described in chapter 707, or of an attempt to commit such an offense, to a work furlough program, conditional release program, or other similar programs, it shall give written notice to each victim of the offense, who has made written request for such notice, of the admission of the committed person to the program. Notice shall be given to the victim at the address given on the request for notice or such address as may be provided to the department by the victim from time to time. Neither the failure of any state officer or employee to carry out the requirements of this section nor compliance with it shall subject the State or the officer or employee to liability in any civil action. However, such failure may provide a basis for such disciplinary action as may be deemed appropriate by competent authority.
