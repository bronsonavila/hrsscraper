<p class="XNotes"> The plain language of this section expressly authorized the department of public safety to maintain only one individual trust account for prisoners pertaining to sums collected while committed; department violated this section where it maintained two accounts with respect to prisoner, one of which restricted withdrawals for purposes determined by the department, and the interest that accrued on prisoner's accounts must be paid on that account. 119 H. 275, 196 P.3d 277 (2008).</p>
