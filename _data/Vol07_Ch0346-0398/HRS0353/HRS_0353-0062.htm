<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Neither chapter 706 nor chapter 353 prohibits the Hawaii paroling authority from setting a prisoner's minimum term at a period equal to his or her maximum sentence. 97 H. 183, 35 P.3d 210 (2001).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As no Hawaii statute governing parole requires a parolees parole to be automatically revoked upon the parolees conviction and sentence to imprisonment for a crime committed while on parole, and this section appears to vest Hawaii paroling authority with discretion to revoke parole, parolees due process right violated when authority summarily revoked parole without giving parolee a final revocation hearing. 88 H. 229 (App.), 965 P.2d 162 (1998).</p>
