<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Where county charter amendment failed to indicate whether its effective date or the first term to count towards the limit of "four consecutive two year terms" was to be postponed to 1998, the amendment became effective on November 25, 1996, which was the day the amendment was "ratified" by a "majority of the electors voting on the amendment"; the first term counted towards the limit of "four consecutive two year terms" was the term that commenced "at twelve o'clock meridian on the first Monday of December after" the 1996 election. 118 H. 355, 191 P.3d 176.</span></p>
