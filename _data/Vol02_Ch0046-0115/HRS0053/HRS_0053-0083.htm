<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง53-83] Powers of county.</b> Any county which pursuant to section 53-81 shall directly rather than through an agency exercise the powers conferred upon an agency by parts I and II of this chapter shall have all powers granted to an agency under such parts, and the provisions of such parts shall be applicable to the county in the exercise of such powers as though the county constituted an agency thereunder.

<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) The provisions of the third, fifth and seventh paragraphs of section 53-8, being inappropriate to the carrying out by the county directly of the purposes of this chapter, shall not be applicable.</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (15) The approval by the council of any plan or project authorized in section 53-20 shall not require any concurrency, including by the officer or department administering or performing the functions of the county under this part.</p>
