<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง53-81] County may exercise urban renewal powers directly.</b> As an alternative to either the creation under section 53-2 of an agency in a county or the continued existence of an agency theretofore created in the county under said section, a county, rather than through such agency, may directly exercise as provided in this part the powers conferred upon an agency by parts I and II of this chapter. In the event that an agency does not then exist in the county, the determination by a county to exercise such powers directly rather than through such an agency shall be made by ordinance of the council. In the event that an agency does then exist in the county, the charter of the county shall provide for the abolition of the agency and for the transfer of the powers, duties and functions of the agency to an officer or department of the county, and the agency shall stand abolished as provided in the charter. Upon such determination or abolition, as the case may be, the county shall then possess all powers granted to a county by this part. [L 1974, c 123, pt of ยง2]</p>
