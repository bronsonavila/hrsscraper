<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> ยง48E-6 Issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance pollution control projects.</b> In addition to the other powers which any county otherwise may have, any county shall have the power and is authorized to issue special purpose revenue bonds to finance, in whole or in part, the costs of a pollution control project. The legislature of the State of Hawaii finds and determines that the exercise of the powers vested in a county by this chapter constitutes assistance to processing enterprises and that the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds to finance facilities of or for a project party is in the public interest.
