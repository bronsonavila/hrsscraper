<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §101-20 Notice.</b> When the owner or claimant of the land sought to be condemned is known, the summons shall be served by delivering to the owner or claimant, or to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process, a certified copy thereof, together with a copy of the plaintiff's complaint. If the owner or claimant, although known, was never a resident of the State or has removed therefrom or cannot for any reason be served with process within the State, or if the owner or claimant is unknown, then the service of the summons upon the owner or claimant may be made in the manner provided by sections 634-23, 634-24, and 634-26. If the defendants are joined in the complaint by describing them as a class, then the service of the summons upon the defendants may be made by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property is situated, in the manner provided by sections 634-23(3) and 634-26, and by giving such further notice as the court may order. The service of summons, as provided for in this section, shall be sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to proceed with and finally determine the case.
