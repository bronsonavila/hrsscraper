<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[§103F-501] Protested awards.</b> (a) A person who is aggrieved by an award of a contract may protest a purchasing agency's failure to follow procedures established by this chapter, rules adopted by the policy board, or a request for proposals in selecting a provider and awarding a purchase of health and human services contract, provided the contract was awarded under section 103F-402 or 103F-403. Amounts payable under a contract awarded under section 103F-402 or 103F-403, and all other awards of health and human services contracts may not be protested and shall be final and conclusive when made.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The protest shall be submitted to the head of the purchasing agency, in writing, within five working days after the postmark date on the notice of award.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The head of the purchasing agency, or a designee, may settle and resolve a protest by one or more of the following means:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Amending or canceling a request for proposal;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Terminating the contract which was awarded;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Initiating a new process to award a contract;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Declaring the contract null and void from the time of its award; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Affirming the purchasing agency's contract award decision.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">This authority shall be exercised in accordance with rules adopted by the policy board.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) If the protest is not resolved by mutual agreement, the head of the purchasing agency, or a designee, shall promptly issue a decision in writing. The decision shall:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) State the reasons for the action taken; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Inform the protesting person of the protester's right to reconsideration as provided in this part.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">A copy of the written decision shall be mailed or otherwise furnished to the person who initiated the protest.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) A decision under subsection (d) shall be final and conclusive unless a request for reconsideration is submitted to the chief procurement officer under section 103F-502. [L 1997, c 190, pt of §2]</p>

<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'></span></p>
<p class="XNotes"> As nothing in this chapter expressly precluded judicial review, it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; judicial review was available in connection with chapter 103F by way of a declaratory action under §632-1. 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Although §632-1 generally endorses declaratory relief in civil cases, it disallows such relief where a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case; where this chapter provided for a protest process under this section through §103F-504, and §103F-504 limited the protestor to an administrative process as the "exclusive means" to resolve contract disputes, declaratory relief under §632-1 was unavailable because §632-1 specifically mandates that the statutory remedy provided in this chapter must be followed. 125 H. 200 (App.), 257 P.3d 213.</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under the express terms of §103D-709(c), petitioner could not seek review of the chief procurement officers decision on a chapter 103F health and human services contract pursuant to chapter 103D unless the protest was decided under one of the sections listed in §103D-709(c); §103D-709(c) thus foreclosed petitioner from seeking review of the chief procurement officers decision made pursuant to this section under the procedures of §103D-709. 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under the circumstances of the case, the decisions of the administrative officers of the department of education to reject the proposal of petitioner that responded to a request for proposals to provide health and human services under contracts pursuant to this chapter were subject to judicial review; §§103F-502(c) and 103F-504 and this section do not prohibit judicial review. 127 H. 263, 277 P.3d 988 (2012).</p>
