<p class="MsoNormal"> As nothing in this chapter expressly precluded judicial review, it did not violate the separation of powers doctrine; judicial review was available in connection with chapter 103F by way of a declaratory action under §632-1. 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under the circumstances of the case, the decisions of the administrative officers of the department of education to reject the proposal of petitioner that responded to a request for proposals to provide health and human services under contracts pursuant to this chapter were subject to judicial review; §§103F-501 and 103F-502(c) and this section do not prohibit judicial review. 127 H. 263, 277 P.3d 988 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Although §632-1 generally endorses declaratory relief in civil cases, it disallows such relief where a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case; where this chapter provided for a protest process under §103F-501 through this section, and this section limited the protestor to an administrative process as the "exclusive means" to resolve contract disputes, declaratory relief under §632-1 was unavailable because §632-1 specifically mandates that the statutory remedy provided in this chapter must be followed. 125 H. 200 (App.), 257 P.3d 213.</span></p>
