<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Although an application of this section was necessary to decide the union's complaint under §89-13, it could not be said that the question arose under chapter 84; where union filed the complaint with the labor relations board under §89-19, the board had "exclusive original jurisdiction" to determine prohibited practice complaints and the ethics commission would not have had jurisdiction to make that determination; thus, the board had the power to apply this section in order to decide whether a prohibited practice violation actually occurred and it did not exceed its jurisdiction in ruling that a violation did not occur based on the application of this section. 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324.</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> As this section prohibited the posting of campaign materials on a union bulletin board on the fourth floor of a state building, and nothing in chapter 89 was explicitly contrary to, or inconsistent with, that construction, there was no conflict between §89-3 and this section. 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324. </span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Where the posting of campaign materials on a union bulletin board on the fourth floor of a state building was prohibited by this section, and was thus not lawful, the postings were not protected under the express language of §89-3 (2006). 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324. </span></p>
