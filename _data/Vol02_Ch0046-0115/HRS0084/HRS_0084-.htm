<p class="XNotes"> As long as the mandatory topics listed in the third paragraph of article XIV of the Hawaii State Constitution are addressed, the legislature exercises discretion over what specific conduct is prohibited, permitted, or otherwise regulated under the state ethics code. Assuming no other state or federal constitutional provision is brought into play, the legislature may exempt certain conduct from the state ethics code or otherwise subject it to related regulation, such as disclosure requirements. Att. Gen. Op. 15-2.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The state ethics code must apply to all state employees; individual employees may not be exempted from the state ethics code. Att. Gen. Op. 15-2.</p>

<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although an application of §84-13 was necessary to decide the union's complaint under §89-13, it could not be said that the question arose under this chapter; where union filed the complaint with the labor relations board under §89-19, the board had "exclusive original jurisdiction" to determine prohibited practice complaints and the ethics commission would not have had jurisdiction to make that determination; thus, the board had the power to apply §84-13 in order to decide whether a prohibited practice violation actually occurred and it did not exceed its jurisdiction in ruling that a violation did not occur based on the application of §84-13. 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The purpose of this chapter is to (1) prescribe a code of ethics for elected officers and public employees of the State as mandated by the people of the State of Hawaii in the Hawaii constitution, article XIV; (2) educate the citizenry with respect to ethics in government; and (3) establish an ethics commission which will administer the codes of ethics adopted by the constitutional convention and by the legislature and render advisory opinions and enforce the provisions of this law so that public confidence in public servants will be preserved.
