<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> District court did not abuse its discretion in granting plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, where court granted a preliminary injunction against operation of Act 355, L 1997 (which amended this section), State's "pay lag" law, on the ground that it impaired the obligations of the employees' collective bargaining agreement in violation of the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution. 183 F.3d 1096.</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction granted, where plaintiffs filed motion seeking to enjoin defendants from delaying payroll under Act 355, L 1997 (which amended this section), with respect to University of Hawaii faculty members, arguing that Act 355 violated the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution because a five-day delay in pay violated the collective bargaining agreement between the State and the faculty members at the University. 16 F. Supp. 2d 1242.</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Where there was no existing contract that Act 355, L 1997 (amending this section), impaired, no contracts clause violation possible and injunction no longer needed; the case was moot. 125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Based upon the legislative history of this section, and where it could not be said that the objective of Act 355, L 1997, which was to balance the state budget by amending this section, was not achieved, the specific implementation dates set forth in this section were mandatory. 111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> The Act 355, L 1997 amendment to this section, which essentially altered the dates when public employees are to be paid, did not violate article XIII, §2 of the Hawaii constitution nor chapter 89 inasmuch as they did not prohibit a state employer from changing the pay dates of its employees; thus, the Act 355 amendment was not unconstitutional. 111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> Where plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that bargaining over pay dates was one of the core subjects of collective bargaining that triggers a violation of article XIII, §2 of the Hawaii constitution, and failed to provide the supreme court with their collective bargaining agreement to support their contention that pay dates are bargainable, and these pay dates were not specifically incorporated into their contract, the Act 355, L 1997 amendment to this section to unilaterally alter the "traditional practice" of being paid on the fifteenth day and last day of the month did not violate their right to collectively bargain pay periods. 111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.</span></p>
