<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§78-29 Incentive and service awards.</b> (a) Each chief executive may establish incentive and service awards programs to recognize employees who contribute to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of government operations or who perform exceptionally meritorious special acts or services in the public interest in connection with or related to their official employment. The programs may allow appointing authorities to establish their own programs consistent with the policies of the chief executive.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The programs may provide for cash awards to recognize suggestions, inventions, superior accomplishments, length of service, and other personal or group efforts. A cash award shall be in addition to the employee's regular compensation. The acceptance of a cash award shall constitute an agreement that use by the government of any idea, method, or device for which the award is made shall not form the basis of a further claim upon the government by the employees or the employees' heirs and assigns.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Awards and expenses for programs may be paid from funds available to the departments and agencies benefiting from or responsible for recognizing the employee's or group of employees' contribution, as determined by the chief executive or appointing authority, as applicable. All administrative decisions made on the issuance of awards under this section shall be final and deemed a performance of a discretionary function of the chief executive or appointing authority.
