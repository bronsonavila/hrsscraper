<p class="XNotes"> Hawaii Public Procurement Code did not apply to board of trustees' current administrator and investment-product-provider contracts because they were entered into before Code's July1, 1994 effective date. The Code would apply to contracts entered into after that date if "public funds" are used to fund them. Att. Gen. Op. 94-4.</p>
