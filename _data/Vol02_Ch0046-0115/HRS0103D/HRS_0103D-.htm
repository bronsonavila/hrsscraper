<p class="XNotes"> The Code did not apply to board of trustees of deferred compensation plan's current administrator and investment-product-provider contracts because they were entered into before the Code's July1, 1994 effective date.

<p class="XNotes"> Procurement code was not relevant to employer's claim for breach of duty of loyalty. 338 F.3d 1082.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Under the express terms of §103D-709(c), petitioner could not seek review of the chief procurement officers decision on a chapter 103F health and human services contract pursuant to this chapter unless the protest was decided under one of the sections listed in §103D-709(c); §103D-709(c) thus foreclosed petitioner from seeking review of the chief procurement officers decision made pursuant to §103F-501 under the procedures of §103D-709. 127 H. 76, 276 P.3d 645 (2012).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiffs had no standing, as a labor union and subcontractor, to invoke the provisions of this code because they were neither contractors nor bidders for the contract in question, and neither this code nor chapter 444 authorized the circuit court to grant the remedies plaintiffs sought, and the court was presented with no other basis for granting the requested relief, the court correctly dismissed the suit. 121 H. 182 (App.), 216 P.3d 108.</p>
