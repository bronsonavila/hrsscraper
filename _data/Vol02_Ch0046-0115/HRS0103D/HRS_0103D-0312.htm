<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) A contractor, except as provided in subsection (e), shall submit cost or pricing data and shall certify that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the cost or pricing data submitted is accurate, complete, and current as of a mutually determined specified date before the date of:</p>
