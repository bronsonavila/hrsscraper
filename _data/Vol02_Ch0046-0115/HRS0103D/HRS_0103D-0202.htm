<p class="XNotes"> Section 3-122-66 (repealed), Hawaii administrative rules, was invalid because it exceeded the scope of the state procurement policy board's authority to promulgate rules pursuant to this section; the circuit court did not err in refusing to declare that the rule "has never been valid and has always been ultra vires and void ab initio". 132 H. 333, 322 P.3d 228 (2014).</p>
