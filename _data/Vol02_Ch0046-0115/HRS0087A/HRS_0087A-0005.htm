<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> L 2005, c 250 amendment. The legislature concluded that the governor's proclamation indicating the governor's intent to return H.B. No. 1548 was constitutionally defective and that said measure became law. On July 13, 2005, the legislature assigned Act 250 to H.B. No. 1548. The attorney general has taken the position that H.B. No. 1548 did not become law.</span></p>
