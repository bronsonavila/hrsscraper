<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> This chapter's use of general trust language does not impose upon the trustees all of the common law fiduciary duties; although this chapter does not use "discretion" in requiring the board to decide upon the structure of the health benefits plan, the legislature clearly intended that the board have broad discretion in its design; where trustees expressed concern regarding the impact a change to a three- or four-tier structure would have on the collective bargaining process, and also determined that the two-tiered structure would have a negative impact on the smallest percentage of plan participants, trustees did not abuse their discretion. 115 H. 126, 165 P.3d 1027.</span></p>
<p class="XNotes"> <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>The words "similarly situated beneficiary not eligible for medicare", as those words are used in §87A-23(1), or "similarly situated employee-beneficiary not eligible for medicare", as those words are used in §87A-23(3), invoke a comparison between medicare eligible retirees and retirees who do not qualify for medicare; thus, this chapter does not require the board of the employer-union health benefits trust fund to provide health benefits plans to retirees whose benefits "reasonably approximate" those benefits provided to active employees. 122 H. 402, 228 P.3d 282.</span></p>
