The election may not be made if, at the time of the member's death, there are individuals who are eligible to receive death benefits under section 88-339 who have made a claim for the benefits; provided that, if the designated beneficiary is an individual eligible to receive benefits under section 88-339, the designated beneficiary may receive benefits pursuant to an election made under this section pending disposition of the claim for benefits under section 88-339. If death benefits are payable under section 88-339, the death benefits shall be in lieu of any benefits payable pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If a retirant dies within one year after the date of retirement, the retirant's designated beneficiary may elect to receive either the death benefit under the retirement allowance option selected by the retirant or the benefits that would have been paid under section 88-338 had the retirant died immediately prior to retirement, less any payments received by the retirant; provided that the designated beneficiary may not elect to receive benefits under option 2 of section 88-83 if the retirant would not have been permitted by applicable law or by the rules of the board to name the designated beneficiary as beneficiary under option 2.</p>
