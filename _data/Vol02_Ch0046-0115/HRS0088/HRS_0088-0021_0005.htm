<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> This section did not undermine employees' retirement system's (ERS) interpretation [of "compensation"]; nothing in the legislative history indicates the legislature intended to alter the content of "compensation" by adding [the definition of "compensation" in this section], and according to ERS administrator, ERS' internal working definition of what was included in compensation remained unchanged. Rather, this section was added to satisfy the Internal Revenue Code of 1982's requirement that a member's benefit be "definitely determinable". 129 H. 107 (App.), 295 P.3d 977 (2013).</p>
