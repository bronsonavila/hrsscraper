Interest shall be calculated on the difference between the amount the retirant is entitled to receive from the retirant's retirement date up to the day the payment is made and the amount the retirant was paid, including any refund of member contributions.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Beginning January 1, 2004, or the first day of the seventh calendar month following the month of retirement when the effective date of retirement is on the first day of the month, or the first day of the eighth calendar month following the month of retirement when the effective date of retirement is December31, whichever is the latest, interest payments calculated as simple interest shall be prorated up to the date payment is made; provided that any pension adjustment made after the retirant's pension has once been finalized shall not be subject to any interest payment.</p>
