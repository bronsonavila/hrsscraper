<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> <b>ยง88-83 Election of retirement allowance option.</b> (a) Upon retirement, any member may elect to receive the maximum retirement allowance to which the member is entitled computed in accordance with section 88-74, 88-76, or 88-80, and in the event of the retirant's death, there shall be paid to the retirant's designated beneficiary, or otherwise to the retirant's estate the difference between:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph" style="line-height:normal"> (1) The balance of the member's accumulated contributions at the time of the member's retirement; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph" style="line-height:normal"> (2) The retirement allowance and, if the retirant retired after November 30, 2004, the post retirement allowances paid or payable to the retirant prior to death.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> In lieu of this maximum allowance, the member may elect to receive the member's retirement allowance under any one of the optional plans described below, which shall be actuarially equivalent to the maximum allowance.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> Option 1: The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member's lifetime. At the member's retirement, there shall be established an amount of initial insurance that shall be computed on the basis of actuarial factors adopted by the board. Upon the death of the retirant, there shall be paid to the retirant's designated beneficiary, otherwise to the retirant's estate: any balance remaining in the initial insurance reserve, after deducting the retirement allowance and, if the retirant retired after November 30, 2004, the post retirement allowances paid to the retirant prior to death. In lieu of the lump sum balance, the beneficiary may, if the beneficiary is a natural person, elect to receive an allowance for life based on the value of the balance; provided that the allowance is not less than $100 per month. If the beneficiary of the retirant who:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph" style="line-height:normal"> (1) Retired after November 30, 2004, and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph" style="line-height:normal"> (2) Dies after June 30, 2007,</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal">elects to receive the allowance in lieu of the lump sum balance, there shall also be payable to the beneficiary an additional allowance calculated and payable in the same manner as a post retirement allowance under section 88-90. The additional allowance shall be based on the original amount of the allowance in lieu of the lump sum balance, and shall commence on the first day of July following the calendar year in which payment of the allowance in lieu of the lump sum balance is effective.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> Option 2: The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and have those allowances, including cumulative post retirement allowances, if applicable, continued after the member's death to the member's beneficiary designated at the time of the member's retirement, for the life of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies prior to the retirant, all further payments shall cease upon the death of the retirant; provided that for members retiring after November 30, 2004, if the retirant's designated beneficiary dies at any time after the retirant retired, but before the death of the retirant, the retirant, upon the death of the retirant's designated beneficiary, shall receive a retirement allowance, including cumulative post retirement allowances, calculated as if the retirant had selected the maximum retirement allowance to which the retirant is entitled. Only one beneficiary shall be designated under this option. The beneficiary designated under this option shall be a natural person, and benefits under this option shall only be paid to a natural person.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> Option 3: The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and have one-half of the allowance, including fifty per cent of all cumulative post retirement allowances, if applicable, continued after the member's death to the member's beneficiary designated at the time of the member's retirement, for the life of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies prior to the retirant, all further payments shall cease upon the death of the retirant; provided that for members retiring after November 30, 2004, if the retirant's designated beneficiary dies at any time after the retirant retired, but before the death of the retirant, the retirant, upon the death of the retirant's designated beneficiary, shall receive a retirement allowance, including cumulative post retirement allowances, calculated as if the retirant had selected the maximum retirement allowance to which the retirant is entitled. Only one beneficiary shall be designated under this option. The beneficiary designated under this option shall be a natural person, and benefits under this option shall only be paid to a natural person.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> Option 4: The member may elect to receive a lesser retirement allowance during the member's lifetime and provide some other benefit to the member's beneficiary in accordance with the member's own specification; provided that this election shall be certified by the actuary to be the actuarial equivalent of the member's retirement allowance and shall be approved by the board.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> Option 5: The member may elect to receive the balance of the member's accumulated contributions at the time of retirement in a lump sum and, during the member's lifetime, a retirement allowance equal to the maximum retirement allowance reduced by the actuarial equivalent of these contributions. Upon the death of the retirant, all further payments shall cease. Only a member retiring from service having at least ten years of credited service or for disability may elect this retirement allowance option.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs" style="line-height:normal"> To receive benefits, the beneficiary must have been designated by the member in the form and manner prescribed by the board.</p>

The effective date of the member's retirement shall be the first day of a month, except for the month of December when the effective date of retirement may be on the first or last day of the month, and shall be no earlier than the later of thirty days from the date the member's retirement application was filed or the day following the member's date of death. The election may not be made if, at the time of the member's death, there are individuals who are eligible to receive death benefits under section 88-85 who have made a claim for the benefits; provided that, if the designated beneficiary is an individual eligible to receive benefits under section 88-85, the designated beneficiary may receive benefits pursuant to an election made under this section pending disposition of the claim for benefits under section 88-85. If death benefits are payable under section 88-85, the death benefits shall be in lieu of any benefits payable pursuant to this section.</p>
