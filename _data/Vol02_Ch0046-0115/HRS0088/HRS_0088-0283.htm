<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Option A: A reduced allowance payable to the member, then upon the member's death, one-half of the allowance, including fifty per cent of all cumulative post retirement allowances, to the member's beneficiary designated by the member at the time of retirement, for the life of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies prior to the retirant, all further payments shall cease upon the death of the retirant; provided that for members retiring after November 30, 2004, if the retirant's designated beneficiary dies at any time after the retirant retired, but before the death of the retirant, the retirant, upon the death of the retirant's designated beneficiary, shall receive a retirement allowance, including cumulative post retirement allowances, calculated as if the retirant had selected the maximum retirement allowance to which the retirant is entitled;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Option C: A reduced allowance payable to the member, and upon the death of the retirant within ten years of retirement, the same allowance, including cumulative post retirement allowances, paid to the retirant's designated beneficiary, or otherwise to the retirant's estate for the balance of the ten-year period. If the retirant returns to service requiring active membership in the system and the retirant is reenrolled as an active member, running of the ten-year period will be suspended until the member again retires.</p>
