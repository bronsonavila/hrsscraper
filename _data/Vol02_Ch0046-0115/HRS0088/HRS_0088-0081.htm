<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) If a member, who became a member before July 1, 2012, has credited service rendered as an elective officer or as a legislative officer, the member's average final compensation shall be computed separately for each category of service as follows:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) For the three highest paid years of credited service as an elective officer, or if the member has fewer than three years of credited service in that capacity, then the member's actual years of credited service;</p>

<p class="XNotes"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'> In general, the calculation of retirement benefits of elective officers who were elective officers on July 1, 1997, pursuant to Act 374, Session Laws of Hawaii 1997, should be made thus: the law as it existed before the effective date of Act 374 (July 1, 1997) is applied to service accrued before the effective date of the Act (i.e., elective officers can apply a high average final compensation to years of possibly multiple types of services, including elective service) and the amount derived from that calculation is added to the amount arrived at by applying the Act to service accrued after the effective date of the Act (which is segregated by service category). This results in using different average final compensations for pre- and post-Act service. Att. Gen. Op. 2000-1.</span></p>
