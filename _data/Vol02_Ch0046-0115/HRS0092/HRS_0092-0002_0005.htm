<p class="XNotes"> Even assuming that written memoranda circulated by council members, in which the council members presented proposed actions, included justifications for the proposals, and sought "favorable consideration" of the proposals constituted a permitted interaction under subsection (a), the memoranda violated the mandate under subsection (b) that no permitted interaction be used to circumvent the spirit or requirements of the sunshine law to make a decision or to deliberate toward a decision upon board business. The "express premise" of the sunshine law is that opening up the government process to public scrutiny is the only viable and reasonable way to protect the public. 130 H. 228, 307 P.3d 1174 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Written memoranda circulated by council members, in which the council members presented proposed actions, included justifications for the proposals, and sought "favorable consideration" of the proposals did not fall within the permitted interaction described in subsection (a) because the memoranda: (1) were distributed among all of the members of the Maui county council rather than among only two members of the board; and (2) sought a commitment to vote by asking for "favorable consideration" of the proposals contained within them and thus, violated the sunshine law. 130 H. 228, 307 P.3d 1174 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Although subsection (a) does not expressly preclude city counsel members from engaging in serial one-on-one conversations, when council members engaged in a series of one-on-one conversations relating to a particular item of council business, under §92-5(b), the spirit of the open meeting requirement was circumvented and the strong policy of having public bodies deliberate and decide its business in view of the public was thwarted and frustrated. 117 H. 1 (App.), 175 P.3d 111.</p>
