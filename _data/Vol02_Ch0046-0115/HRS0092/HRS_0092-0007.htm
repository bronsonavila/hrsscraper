<p class="XNotes"> Based on the office of information practice's construction of the sunshine law as well as the legislative history of subsection (d), the land use commission and Maui county council did not violate the sunshine law by continuing and reconvening meetings beyond a single continuance without requiring a new agenda and additional public testimony to be accepted at every continued meeting. However, while the legislature did not expressly limit the number of continuances permissible under subsection (d), the legislative history and text of the sunshine law demonstrates that boards are constrained at all times by the spirit of and purpose of the sunshine law, as stated in §92-1. 130 H. 228, 307 P.3d 1174 (2013).</p>
