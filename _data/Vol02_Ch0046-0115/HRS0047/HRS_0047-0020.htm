<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §47-20 Garnishee to withhold funds.</b> It shall not be incumbent on the garnishee to appear and answer the process, but the trial of the action shall proceed in all respects as if the garnishee had not been made a party. From the time of service upon the garnishee, it shall be unlawful for the garnishee to draw, sign, or issue any warrant payable to the order of the county defendant or any of its officers, or permit or cause the same to be done, for any money which be then or thereafter payable to the defendant, until the action has been finally determined and the judgment therein rendered, if any, has been fully paid and satisfied with legal interest thereon. All moneys due or to become due to the defendant shall be held in the treasury of the State from the time of the service until the final judgment or determination of the action; provided that no more shall thus be held than shall be sufficient to meet the demand with costs and interest of plaintiff or plaintiffs in the action.
