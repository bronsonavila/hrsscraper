<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Where the interest on the bonds is payable other than annually or semiannually or will vary from time to time, upon a basis that, in the opinion of the director of finance, shall result in the lowest cost to the county;</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">provided that in any case the right shall be reserved to reject any or all bids and waive any irregularity or informality in any bid.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Bonds offered at competitive sale, without further action of the governing body, shall bear interest at the rate or rates specified by the successful bidder or varying rate or rates determined from time to time in the manner specified by the successful bidder with the consent of the director of finance. The notice of sale required by this section shall be given at least once and at least five days prior to the date of the sale in the county and in a financial newspaper or newspapers published in any of the cities of New York, Chicago, or San Francisco, and shall be in a form and contain terms and conditions that the director of finance shall determine. The notice of sale shall comply with the requirements of this section if it merely advises prospective purchasers of the proposed sale and makes reference to a detailed notice of sale which is available to the prospective purchasers and which sets forth the specific details of the bonds and terms and conditions upon which the bonds are to be offered. The notice of sale and any detailed notice of sale may omit the date and time of sale, in which event the date and time shall be either given in the same manner and medium in which the original notice of sale was given, or transmitted via electronic communication systems deemed proper by the director of finance which is generally available to the financial community, in either case at least forty-eight hours prior to the time fixed for the sale.
