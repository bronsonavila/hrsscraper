<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) All such issuing agencies shall clearly articulate informational requirements for applications and review applications for completeness in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) All such issuing agencies shall take action to grant or deny any application for a business or development-related permit, license, or approval within the established maximum period of time, or the application shall be deemed approved; provided that a delay in granting or denying an application caused by the lack of quorum at a regular meeting of the issuing agency shall not result in approval under this subsection; provided further that any subsequent lack of quorum at a regular meeting of the issuing agency that delays the same matter shall not give cause for further extension, unless an extension is agreed to by all parties.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, any agency that reviews and comments upon an application for a business or development-related permit, license, or approval for a housing project developed under section 201H-38 shall respond within forty-five days of receipt of the application, or the application shall be deemed acceptable as submitted to the agency.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) The maximum period of time established pursuant to this section shall be extended in the event of a national disaster, state emergency, or union strike, which would prevent the applicant, the agency, or the department from fulfilling application or review requirements.</p>

<p class="XNotes"> The liquor commission's failure to comply with §91-11, requiring that all commissioners personally consider the entire record before voting on a liquor license application, was not a "failure to act" such as would trigger the automatic approval provision of this section where the liquor commission voted, albeit ineffectively, within the fifteen day period prescribed by §281-59. 118 H. 320, 189 P.3d 432.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The intermediate court of appeals correctly determined that provisions of the Kauai County Code authorizing permit applicants to assent to a delay of automatic approval deadlines did not conflict with this section. 133 H. 141, 324 P.3d 951 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"><b> </b>Assent provisions in two Kauai county ordinances applicable to a use permit and a class IV zoning permit did not conflict with this section; while the legislative history indicates that the purposes for enacting this section include streamlining administrative processes and improving Hawaii's business climate, the legislative history as a whole contemplates flexibility in rule-making and a balance between streamlining on one hand and constitutional demands, public input, and environmental concerns on the other hand. 130 H. 407 (App.), 312 P.3d 283 (2013).</p>
