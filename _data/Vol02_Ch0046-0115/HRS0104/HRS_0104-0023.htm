<p class="XNotes"> In the absence of an express time frame within which the labor director must issue a notice of violation (NOV) under this section, the department must issue notifications of violations within a reasonable time; department's two-year delay in issuing a third NOV was unreasonable as it did not have to wait until the appeal on the second NOV had been completed before determining whether another violation had taken place. 104 H. 412, 91 P.3d 494.</p>
