The arbitration panel shall decide whether final positions are compliant with this provision and which proposals may be considered for inclusion in the final agreement.</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (C) Arbitration hearing. Within one hundred twenty days of its appointment, the arbitration panel shall commence a hearing at which time the parties may submit either in writing or through oral testimony, all information or data supporting their respective final positions.

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (D) Arbitration decision.

Within fifteen days after the transmittal of the preliminary draft, a majority of the arbitration panel shall issue the arbitration decision.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) An arbitration panel in reaching its decision shall give weight to the following factors and shall include in its written report or decision an explanation of how the factors were taken into account:</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The interests and welfare of the public;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) The financial ability of the employer to meet these costs; provided that the employer's ability to fund cost items shall not be predicated on the premise that the employer may increase or impose new taxes, fees, or charges, or develop other sources of revenues;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) The present and future general economic condition of the counties and the State;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) Comparison of wages, hours, and conditions of employment of the employees involved in the arbitration proceeding with the wages, hours, and conditions of employment of other persons performing similar services, and of other state and county employees in Hawaii;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) The average consumer prices for goods or services, commonly known as the cost of living;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (8) The overall compensation presently received by the employees, including direct wage compensation, vacation, holidays and excused time, insurance and pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, the continuity and stability of employment, and all other benefits received;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (9) Changes in any of the foregoing circumstances during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (10) Such other factors, not confined to the foregoing, which are normally or traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of wages, hours, and conditions of employment through voluntary collective bargaining, mediation, arbitration, or otherwise between the parties, in the public service or in private employment.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) The decision of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding upon the parties on all provisions submitted to the arbitration panel. If the parties have reached agreement with respect to the amounts of contributions by the State and counties to the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund by the tenth working day after the arbitration panel issues its decision, the final and binding agreement of the parties on all provisions shall consist of the panel's decision and the amounts of contributions agreed to by the parties. If the parties have not reached agreement with respect to the amounts of contributions by the State and counties to the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund by the close of business on the tenth working day after the arbitration panel issues its decision, the parties shall have five days to submit their respective recommendations for such contributions to the legislature, if it is in session, and if the legislature is not in session, the parties shall submit their respective recommendations for such contributions to the legislature during the next session of the legislature. In such event, the final and binding agreement of the parties on all provisions shall consist of the panel's decision and the amounts of contributions established by the legislature by enactment, after the legislature has considered the recommendations for such contributions by the parties. It is strictly understood that no member of a bargaining unit subject to this subsection shall be allowed to participate in a strike on the issue of the amounts of contributions by the State and counties to the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund. The parties shall take whatever action is necessary to carry out and effectuate the final and binding agreement. The parties may, at any time and by mutual agreement, amend or modify the panel's decision.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Agreements reached pursuant to the decision of an arbitration panel and the amounts of contributions by the State and counties to the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund, as provided herein, shall not be subject to ratification by the employees concerned. All items requiring any moneys for implementation shall be subject to appropriations by the appropriate legislative bodies and the employer shall submit all such items within ten days after the date on which the agreement is entered into as provided herein, to the appropriate legislative bodies.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (h) Any time frame provided in an impasse procedure, whether an alternate procedure or the procedures in this section, may be modified by mutual agreement of the parties. In the absence of a mutual agreement to modify time frames, any delay, failure, or refusal by either party to participate in the impasse procedure shall not be permitted to halt or otherwise delay the process, unless the board so orders due to an unforeseeable emergency. The process shall commence or continue as though all parties were participating.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (i) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the parties from reaching a voluntary settlement on the unresolved issues at any time prior to the issuance of an arbitration decision.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (j) The costs and expenses for mediation provided under subsection (d) or (e) shall be borne by the board. The costs and expenses for any other services performed by neutrals pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties and the costs for a neutral arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties. All other costs incurred by either party in complying with this section, including the costs of its selected member on the arbitration panel, shall be borne by the party incurring them.

<p class="XNotes"> Where arbitration between the State and union representing state employees was statutorily mandated arbitration pursuant to subsection (e), and not a voluntary agreement to arbitrate, the Hawaii labor relations board had original jurisdiction over the parties' dispute pursuant to ยง89-14; circuit court did not have jurisdiction pursuant to chapter 658A because that chapter was inapplicable. 134 H. 489, 345 P.3d 155 (2015).</p>

<p class="XNotes"> Where neither the government-employee union (union) nor the government employers challenged the terms of the arbitration award or sought to invalidate the arbitration award and where the union filed a motion in circuit court to confirm the arbitration award, the issues raised on appeal by the union relating to the selection of the neutral arbitrator were moot. However, the issues of whether the Hawaii labor relations board (board) or the circuit court had original jurisdiction to resolve the dispute over the selection of the neutral arbitrator and whether the board exceeded its authority in issuing its order for interlocutory relief fell within the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine. 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the government-employee union's (union) claim that the government employers violated the terms of the arbitration award by failing to meet and confer as required by the arbitration award involved a controversy concerning prohibited practices, the Hawaii labor relations board had exclusive original jurisdiction over the claims raised in the union's motion for civil contempt, and the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to decide the motion for civil contempt. 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the parties' actions precluded the arbitration from commencing on the date agreed upon under a memorandum of agreement and threatened the timely resolution of the impasse, the Hawaii labor relations board did not abuse its discretion in facilitating a timely resolution of the parties' stalemate in selecting a neutral arbitrator by having the American Arbitration Association select the neutral arbitrator. 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the parties' claims regarding their dispute over the selection of a neutral arbitrator, as alleged in their prohibited practice complaints, clearly involved a controversy concerning prohibited practices, the Hawaii labor relations board had exclusive original jurisdiction to determine the controversy concerning the selection of the neutral arbitrator. 132 H. 492 (App.), 323 P.3d 136 (2014).</p>
