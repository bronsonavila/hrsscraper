<p class="XNotes"> Dates upon which plaintiffs were paid not a "cost item" as that term is defined in this section. 125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> "Impasse" means failure after good-faith negotiations. 56 H. 85, 528 P.2d 809.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Though designated as an "incumbent" employee, plaintiff was "essential employee" where plaintiff: (1) received notice by same means as essential employee; (2) was prohibited from striking; and (3) was subject to discipline for not working if scheduled to work during a strike. 87 H. 191, 953 P.2d 569.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that bargaining over pay dates was one of the core subjects of collective bargaining that triggers a violation of article XIII, §2 of the Hawaii constitution, and failed to provide the supreme court with their collective bargaining agreement to support their contention that pay dates are bargainable, and these pay dates were not specifically incorporated into their contract, the Act 355, L 1997 amendment to §78-13 to unilaterally alter the "traditional practice" of being paid on the fifteenth day and last day of the month did not violate their right to collectively bargain pay periods. 111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.</p>
