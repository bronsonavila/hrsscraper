The ordinances may prescribe the instances when land shall be provided in perpetuity or dedicated, the area, location, grade, and other state of the sites so required to be provided or dedicated.

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Combine the payment of money with land to be provided or dedicated, the value of such combination to be as deemed adequate by the county to purchase the total amount of land the subdivider would otherwise have had to provide or dedicate.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The method of determining such full or partial payment shall be prescribed by the ordinances. The ordinances shall also provide that such money shall be used for the purpose of providing parks and playgrounds for the use of purchasers or occupants of lots or units in the subdivision.

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Upon the provision of land in perpetuity or the dedication of land by the subdivider as may be required under this section, the county concerned shall thereafter assume the cost of improvements and their maintenance, and the subdivider shall accordingly be relieved from such costs.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) The ordinances adopted pursuant to this section may provide, where special circumstances, conditions, and needs within the respective counties so warrant, for such exemptions and exclusions as the councils of the respective counties may deem necessary or appropriate and may also prescribe the extent to and the circumstances under which the requirements therein shall or shall not be applicable to subdivisions.</p>
