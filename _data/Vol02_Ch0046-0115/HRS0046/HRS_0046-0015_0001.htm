<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Each county shall recognize housing units developed by the department of Hawaiian home lands and issue affordable housing credits to the department of Hawaiian home lands. The credits shall be transferable and shall be issued on a one-credit for one-unit basis, unless the housing unit is eligible for additional credits as provided by adopted county ordinances, rules, or any memoranda of agreement between a county and the department of Hawaiian home lands.

Credits shall be issued for each single-family residence, multi-family unit, other residential unit, whether for purposes of sale or rental, or if allowed under the county's affordable housing programs, vacant lot, developed by the department of Hawaiian home lands. The credits may be applied county-wide within the same county in which the credits were earned to satisfy affordable housing obligations imposed by the county on market-priced residential and non-residential developments. County-wide or project-specific requirements for housing class, use, or type; or construction time for affordable housing units shall not impair, restrict, or condition the county's obligation to apply the credits in full satisfaction of all county requirements, whether by rule, ordinance, or particular zoning conditions of a project. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the department may enter into a memorandum of agreement with the county of Kauai to establish, modify, or clarify the conditions for the issuance, transfer, and redemption of the affordable housing credits in accordance with county affordable housing ordinances or rules. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the department may enter into a memorandum of agreement with the city and county of Honolulu to establish, modify, or clarify the conditions for the issuance, transfer, and redemption of the affordable housing credits in accordance with county affordable housing ordinances or rules. At least half of the affordable housing credits issued by the city and county of Honolulu shall be subject to a memorandum of agreement pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> For purposes of this section, "affordable housing obligation" means the requirement imposed by a county, regardless of the date of its imposition, to develop vacant lots, single-family residences, multi-family residences, or any other type of residence for sale or rent to individuals within a specified income range.</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Appropriate moneys of the county to carry out the purposes of this section;</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a county may waive its right to repurchase a privately-developed affordable housing unit built pursuant to a unilateral agreement or similar instrument, and may transfer that right of repurchase to a qualified nonprofit housing trust for the purpose of maintaining the unit as affordable for as long as required by the county program.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> For the purposes of this subsection, "qualified nonprofit housing trust" means a corporation, association, or other duly chartered organization that is registered and in good standing with the State; that is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a charitable or otherwise tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and that has the capacity, resources, and mission to carry out the purposes of this section as determined by the county in which the housing unit is located.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) A qualified nonprofit housing trust shall report the status and use of its housing units to its respective county by November 30 of each calendar year.</p>
