<p class="XNotes"> Because the city is neither the sovereign nor the surrogate or alter ego of the sovereign, it is not entitled to sovereign immunity; thus, it is subject to the State's tort laws in the same manner as any private tortfeasor; as §657-13 governs classes of "personal" tort actions, such as "damage to persons or property", the infancy tolling provision of §657-13(1) applies directly to personal injury actions against the city; child was thus able to bring action, but as §657-13(1) did not provide for tolling of parents' derivative actions and they did not timely comply with this section, their individual claims were barred. 104 H. 341, 90 P.3d 233.</p>
