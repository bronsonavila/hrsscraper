<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §102-3 Qualification of bidders.</b> Before any prospective bidder is entitled to submit any bid for the occupancy of any such space, the prospective bidder shall, not less than six calendar days prior to the day designated for opening bids, give written notice to the officer charged with letting the contract of the prospective bidder's intention to bid, and the officer shall satisfy oneself of the prospective bidder's financial ability, experience and competence to carry out the terms and conditions of any contract that may be awarded. For this purpose, the officer may, in the officer's discretion, require prospective bidders to submit answers, under oath, to questions contained in a form of questionnaire setting forth a complete statement of the experience, competence and financial standing of the prospective bidders. Whenever it appears to the officer, from answers to the questionnaire or otherwise, that any prospective bidder is not fully qualified and able to carry out the terms and conditions of the contract that may be awarded, the officer shall, after affording the prospective bidder an opportunity to be heard and if still of the opinion that the bidder is not fully qualified to carry out the terms and conditions of the contract that may be awarded, refuse to receive or consider any bid offered by the prospective bidder. The officer charged with letting the contract shall not divulge or permit to be divulged the names and the number of persons who have submitted their notice of intention to bid until after the opening of bids. All information contained in the answers to questionnaires shall remain confidential, and any government officer or employee who knowingly divulges or permits to be divulged any such information to any person not fully entitled thereto shall be fined not more than $250. Questionnaires so submitted shall be returned to the bidders after having served their purpose. [L 1959, c 245, §2; am L 1962, c 5, §3; Supp, §7B-2; HRS §102-3; gen ch 1985]</p>
