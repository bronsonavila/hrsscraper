The legislature, by a majority vote of each house in joint session, shall appoint an ombudsman who shall serve for a period of six years and thereafter until a successor shall have been appointed. An ombudsman may be reappointed but may not serve for more than three terms. The legislature, by two-thirds vote of the members in joint session, may remove or suspend the ombudsman from office, but only for neglect of duty, misconduct, or disability.</p>

Effective July 1, 2005, the salary of the ombudsman shall be the same as the salary of the director of health. The salary of the ombudsman shall not be diminished during the ombudsman's term of office, unless by general law applying to all salaried officers of the State.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> If the ombudsman dies, resigns, becomes ineligible to serve, or is removed or suspended from office, the first assistant to the ombudsman becomes the acting ombudsman until a new ombudsman is appointed for a full term.
