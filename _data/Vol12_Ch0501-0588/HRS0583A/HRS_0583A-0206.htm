<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง583A-206] Simultaneous proceedings. </b>(a) Except as otherwise provided in section 583A-204, a court of this State shall not exercise its jurisdiction under this part if, at the time of the commencement of the proceeding, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child has been commenced in a court of another state having jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this chapter, unless the proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by the court of the other state because a court of this State is a more convenient forum under section 583A-207.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Except as otherwise provided in section 583A-204, a court of this State, before hearing a child-custody proceeding, shall examine the court documents and other information supplied by the parties pursuant to section 583A-209. If the court determines that a child-custody proceeding has been commenced in a court in another state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this chapter, the court of this State shall stay its proceeding and communicate with the court of the other state.

<p class="XNotes"> Where the family court made the initial child-custody determination several years before a petition was filed in a Florida court, thereby granting Hawaii exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, this section was not relevant to the proceedings because: (1) this section is not applicable where there is a state with already-established, exclusive, continuing jurisdiction; and (2) even assuming that there was concurrent jurisdiction with Florida, this section contains a "first in time" rule, so Florida could not have exercised jurisdiction unless Hawaii first declined because it determined that Florida was a more convenient forum. 133 H. 436 (App.), 329 P.3d 341 (2014).</p>
