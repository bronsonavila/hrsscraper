<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (8) The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (9) The physical and psychological health of the parties.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If a court of this State determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) A court of this State may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if a child-custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding, while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.
