<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the interest in the subject property shall be transferred to the designated beneficiary in accordance with the deed; provided that, for property of which any portion is registered in the land court pursuant to chapter 501, a petition noting the death of the transferor and requesting that a new certificate of title be issued in the name of the designated beneficiary shall be filed and processed with the land court before the interest in the subject property is transferred;</p>
