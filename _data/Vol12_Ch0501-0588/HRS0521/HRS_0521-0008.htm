<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> While defendant was "a tenant" as defined by this Code, defendant's tenancy was not as a sublessee, but as a licensee of defendant's roommate, where defendant did not have exclusive possession of the property, the unilateral right to assign defendant's interest in the property, and defendant's agreement was not for a fixed term; thus, as the holder of a license revocable at will, defendant became a trespasser when the licensor roommate's interest in the property ceased. 109 H. 296, 126 P.3d 339.</p>
