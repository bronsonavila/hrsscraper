<p class="XNotes"> In a paternity action, ยง584-13 and this section mandate that an informal, pre-trial hearing be held by the court to evaluate the likelihood of establishing at trial the alleged father as the natural father, to determine whether declaring paternity would be in the best interest of the child, and to recommend settlement to the parties; such a hearing is not required before a court may order genetic testing of the parties. 88 H. 159 (App.), 963 P.2d 1135.</p>
