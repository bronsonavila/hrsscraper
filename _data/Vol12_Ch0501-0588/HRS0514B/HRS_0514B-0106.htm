In the performance of their duties, officers and members of the board shall owe the association a fiduciary duty and exercise the degree of care and loyalty required of an officer or director of a corporation organized under chapter 414D. Any violation by a board or its officers or members of the mandatory provisions of section 514B-161 or 514B-162 may constitute a violation of the fiduciary duty owed pursuant to this subsection; provided that a board member may avoid liability under this subsection by indicating in writing the board member's disagreement with such board action or rescinding or withdrawing the violating conduct within forty-five days of the occurrence of the initial violation.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> </span><span style="layout-grid-mode:line">(b) The board may not act on behalf of the association to amend the declaration or bylaws (sections </span>514B‑<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">32(a)(11) and 514B‑108(b)(7)), to remove the condominium from the provisions of this chapter (section </span>514B‑<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">47), or to elect members of the board or determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of office of board members (subsection (e)); provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit board members from voting proxies (section </span>514B‑<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">123) to elect members of the board; provided further that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the declaration or bylaws, the board may only fill vacancies in its membership to serve until the next annual or duly noticed special association meeting. Notice of a special association meeting to fill vacancies shall include notice of the election. Any special association meeting to fill vacancies shall be held on a date that allows sufficient time for owners to declare their intention to run for election and to solicit proxies for that purpose.</span></p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Sixty days after conveyance of seventy-five per cent of the common interest appurtenant to units that may be created to unit owners other than a developer or affiliate of the developer;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Two years after the developer has ceased to offer units for sale in the ordinary course of business;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Two years after any right to add new units was last exercised; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) The day the developer, after giving written notice to unit owners, records an instrument voluntarily surrendering all rights to control activities of the association.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">A developer may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and members of the board before termination of that period, but in that event the developer may require, for the duration of the period of developer control, that specified actions of the association or board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the developer, be approved by the developer before they become effective.</p>
