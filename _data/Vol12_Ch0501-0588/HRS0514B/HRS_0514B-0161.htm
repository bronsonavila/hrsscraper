<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b><span style="color:black;layout-grid-mode:line"> §514B-161 Mediation.</span></b><span style="color:black;layout-grid-mode:line"> (a) </span>If an apartment owner or the board of directors requests mediation of a dispute involving the interpretation or enforcement of the association of apartment owners' declaration, bylaws, or house rules, the other party in the dispute shall be required to participate in mediation. Each party shall be wholly responsible for its own costs of participating in mediation, unless both parties agree that one party shall pay all or a specified portion of the mediation costs. If a <span style="letter-spacing: -.15pt">party </span>refuses to participate in the mediation of a particular dispute, a court may take this refusal into consideration when awarding expenses, costs, and attorneys' fees.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Nothing in subsection (a) shall be interpreted to mandate the mediation of any dispute involving:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"><span style="color:black;layout-grid-mode:line"> (1) </span>Actions seeking equitable relief involving threatened property damage or the health or safety of association members or any other person;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Actions against an association, a board, or one or more directors, officers, agents, employees, or other persons for amounts in excess of $2,500 if insurance coverage under a policy of insurance procured by the association or its board would be unavailable for defense or judgment because mediation was pursued.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) If any mediation under this section is not completed within two months from commencement, no further mediation shall be required unless agreed to by the parties.
