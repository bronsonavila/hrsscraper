<p class="1Paragraph"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (1) A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer, and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed upon the transferor by this chapter, if any. Lack of privity does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor;</span></p>
<p class="1Paragraph"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line"> (2) If a successor to any developer right is an affiliate of a developer, the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to the condominium;</span></p>

Thereafter, until transferring all developer rights to any person acquiring title to any unit or real estate subject to development rights owned by the successor, or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by the transferor to control the board in accordance with section </span>514B‑<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">106(d) for the duration of any period of developer control, and any attempted exercise of those rights is void.
