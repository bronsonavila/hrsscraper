<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>[ยง523A-13] Public sale of abandoned property.</b> (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the administrator, within three years after the receipt of abandoned property, shall sell it to the highest bidder at public sale at a location in the State which in the judgment of the administrator affords the most favorable market for the property. The administrator may decline the highest bid and reoffer the property for sale if the administrator considers the bid to be insufficient. The administrator need not offer the property for sale if the administrator considers that the probable cost of sale will exceed the proceeds of the sale. A sale held under this section shall be preceded by a single publication of notice, at least three weeks before sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property is to be sold.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Securities listed on an established stock exchange shall be sold at prices prevailing on the exchange at the time of sale. Other securities may be sold over-the-counter at prices prevailing at the time of sale or by any reasonable method selected by the administrator. If securities are sold by the administrator before the expiration of three years after their delivery to the administrator, a person making a valid claim under this part before the end of the three-year period shall be entitled to the proceeds of the sale of the securities or the market value of the securities at the time the valid claim is made, whichever is greater, plus dividends, interest, and other increments thereon up to the time the valid claim is made, less any deduction for expenses of sale. A person making a valid claim under this part after the expiration of the three-year period shall be entitled to receive the securities delivered to the administrator by the holder, if they still remain in the custody of the administrator, or the net proceeds received from sale, and shall not be entitled to receive any appreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery to the administrator, except in a case of intentional misconduct or malfeasance by the administrator.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) A purchaser of property at a sale conducted by the administrator pursuant to this part shall take the property free of all claims of the owner or previous holder and of all persons claiming through or under them. The administrator shall execute all documents necessary to complete the transfer of ownership. [L 2008, c 55, pt of ยง1]</p>
