<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center"><b>PURPOSE</b></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 United States Code section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Return juveniles who have run away, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control, or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency that has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (8) Ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (9) Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (10) Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (11) Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (12) Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (13) Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the interstate compact for the placement of children, the interstate compact for adult offender supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles, particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.</p>

No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.</p>

<p align="center" class="RegularParagraphs" style="text-align:center"><b>WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT</b></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>Section A. Withdrawal.</b> (a) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided that a compacting state may withdraw ("withdrawing state") from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> Section B. Technical assistance, fines, suspension, termination, and default.</b> (a) If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or duly adopted rules, the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Alternative dispute resolution;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the interstate commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the chief justice or the chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include but are not limited to failure of a compacting state to perform obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or duly adopted rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council of the termination.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> Section C. Judicial enforcement.</b> The interstate commission, by majority vote of the members, may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district court where the interstate commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, and its duly adopted rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>Section D. Dissolution of compact.</b> (a) The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes void and shall be of no further effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) All compacting states' laws other than state constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.</p>
