<p class="XNotes"> Use of term "temporary residence" in project's instruments does not authorize time sharing. 70 H. 93, 762 P.2d 169.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> As this section, relating to time sharing, applies to a project that is not a hotel and the Maui county code section pertained to time sharing in a hotel district, the code section did not cover the same subject matter or conflict with this section; thus, the code section was not preempted by this section. 103 H. 468, 83 P.3d 731.</p>
