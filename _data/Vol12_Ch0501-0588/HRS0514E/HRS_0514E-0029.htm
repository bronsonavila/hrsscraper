<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Foreclosure under power of sale, if the power of sale is contained in the governing documents of the association, or in the original deed of the time share interest;</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">provided that the procedures and notice requirements contained in chapter 667 shall govern.

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) Where the association or other purchaser obtains title to the time share interest as a result of the foreclosure of the association's lien, the acquirer of title and the acquirer's successors and assigns shall not be liable for the share of the expenses or assessments by the association chargeable to the time share interest which became due prior to the acquisition of title to the time share interest by the acquirer. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the unpaid share of expenses or assessments shall be deemed to be expenses collectible from all of the time share owners, including the acquirer and the acquirer's successors and assigns.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) Nothing in this section prohibits the association from bringing an action to recover a money judgment against the owner of a time share interest for unpaid assessments and expenses without first either foreclosing or waiving the association's lien securing the same.
