<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "LEGAL EFFECT OF CERTIFICATION BY A COMMISSIONER OF DEEDS</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">A certification by a Hawaii commissioner of deeds is intended only to confirm that a document was signed by a person whose signature appears on it. It does not validate the substance, contents, or legal effect of the document, nor indicate that the document has been approved or endorsed by any governmental authority, including the State of Hawaii. The documents that you are signing may have legal consequences, and you may have rights under Hawaii law. By signing below, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this."</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The content of the notice may be varied as necessary to convey the intended concepts in the other language; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Neither the commissioner nor any other person shall be liable for errors in translation of the notice required by subsection (a) so long as a good faith effort to accurately translate the notice was made.</p>
