<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The individual seeking the order resides outside this State; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The support enforcement agency seeking the order is located outside this State.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The tribunal may issue a temporary child support order if the tribunal determines that the order is appropriate and the individual ordered to pay is:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) A presumed father of the child;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Petitioning to have paternity adjudicated;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Identified as the father of the child through genetic testing;</p>

<p class="XNotes"> If a support order does not already exist pursuant to subsection (a), the provisions of subsection (b) allow the responding tribunal of this State to order the respondent to pay temporary child support if there is sufficient indication, as defined by the statute, that the respondent is indeed the child's parent; thus, the prepetition support awarded by the court was well within the powers afforded the court by this chapter. 96 H. 373 (App.), 31 P.3d 230.</p>
