<p class="XNotes"> Where New Mexico had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over its spousal support order, New Mexico could act as a responding tribunal to enforce or modify its order; husband and wife were subject to the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of New Mexico notwithstanding the fact that neither resided in New Mexico; because Hawaii lacked continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over New Mexico's spousal support order, Hawaii could not serve as a responding tribunal to modify New Mexico's spousal support order, but could enforce it. 111 H. 51 (App.), 137 P.3d 365 (2006).</p>
