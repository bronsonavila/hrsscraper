<p class="XNotes"> Subsection (a) requires lessees of condominium units to which 75 per cent of the common interests are appurtenant to approve of a leased fee purchase; because subsection (a) is silent on the method of calculating the votes of multi-owner units, the bylaws of an association of apartment owners may govern on how the votes are to be calculated so long as not violative of any law; if any defects affected the approval process, the 75 per cent requirement was satisfied by the lessees' subsequent ratification of the previous vote when they executed deeds necessary for conversion. 108 H. 2, 116 P.3d 644.</p>
<p class="XNotes">Under subsection (a)(3), an association of apartment owners may assess a "conversion" surcharge in "a fair and equitable manner" against lessees who oppose a fee purchase. 108 H. 2, 116 P.3d 644.</p>
