<p class="XNotes"> Where joint custodial parents are deadlocked regarding an important decision implicating their child's future or welfare, such an impasse qualifies as a material change in circumstances sufficient to warrant the family court's consideration of a change in the custody order's terms with respect to the deadlocked matter. 133 H. 415 (App.), 329 P.3d 320 (2014).</p>
