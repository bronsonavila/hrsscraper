<p class="XNotes"> Family court had subject matter jurisdiction to issue temporary restraining order under §§560:1-302(b), 560:5-106(2) and (3), and this section, where resolution of ward's capacity was required to be resolved, and an apparent threat of ward's removal from the court's jurisdiction was alleged. 113 H. 211, 151 P.3d 692 (2007).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Family court abused its discretion when it denied wife's multiple requests for an extension of pretrial deadlines and sanctioned wife for missing the deadlines by excluding evidence where record revealed that although trial was delayed a month to accommodate the personal schedule of the assigned trial judge and husband agreed to extend the pretrial deadlines for both parties, the family court refused to grant wife any extensions and did not explain why it denied wife's various motions for an extension of pretrial deadlines. 121 H. 401 (App.), 220 P.3d 264 (2009).</p>
