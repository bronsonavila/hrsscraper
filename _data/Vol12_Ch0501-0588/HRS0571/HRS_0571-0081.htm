<p class="RegularParagraphs"></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§571-81 Contempt of court. </b>(a) Any adult who wilfully violates, neglects, or refuses to obey or perform any lawful order of the court may be proceeded against for contempt of court. Any adult found in contempt of court may be punished as provided by law.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) <span style="color:black">When a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order compelling a parent to furnish support, including child support, medical support, or other remedial care, for the parent's child, it shall constitute prima facie evidence of a civil contempt of court upon proof that:</span></p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The order was made, filed, and served on the parent or proof that the parent was present in court at the time the order was pronounced; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The parent did not comply with the order.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs">An order of civil contempt of court based on prima facie evidence under this subsection shall clearly state that the failure to comply with the order of civil contempt of court may subject the parent to a penalty that may include imprisonment or, if imprisonment is immediately ordered, the conditions that must be met for release from imprisonment. A party may also prove civil contempt of court by means other than prima facie evidence under this subsection. [L 1965, c 232, pt of §1; Supp, §333-36; HRS §571-81; am L 2008, c 157, §1]</p>
