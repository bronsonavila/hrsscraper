Informal adjustment under this section may include, among other suitable methods, programs, and procedures, listed in section 571-31.4(c), except section 571‑31.4(c)(1), and provided that placement with shelter facilities under section 571-31.4(c)(9) shall be on a nonsecure basis unless the child is processed under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) In the event resources and services for informal adjustment are not available, have failed, are reasonably believed to fail if attempted, or are unable to respond to the needs of the child or family, the intake officer shall proceed with formal action, or take such action as is otherwise allowed under this chapter.
