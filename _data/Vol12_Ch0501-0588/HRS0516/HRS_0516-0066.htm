<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Compute to nearest whole year, one hundred per cent of the unexpired period of fixed rent at the commencement of the extended term;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Multiply the number of years computed in (1) by the fixed annual rent in effect immediately prior to the extension;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Deduct from thirty years the number of years computed in (1) and multiply that difference by the annual rent determined by mutual agreement of lessor and lessee within thirty days after such extension or by arbitration in accord with chapter 658A; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Add the amounts computed in (2) and (3) and divide that sum by thirty. This sum rounded to the nearest dollar shall be the annual rent for the first thirty years of the extended term; provided that such rent shall not without the consent of the lessor be less than the annual rent in effect immediately prior to such extension.</p>
