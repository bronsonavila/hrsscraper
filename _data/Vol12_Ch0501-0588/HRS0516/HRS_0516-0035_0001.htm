<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§516-35.1 Foreclosure and sale by mortgagees.</b> If the leased fee, fee simple title or lease to a lot, purchased or acquired from the Hawaii housing finance and development corporation under this chapter is secured by a mortgage held by a lending institution authorized to do business as a lending institution either in the State or elsewhere in the United States, upon foreclosure of the mortgage, the leased fee, the fee simple title or the lease may be sold to any purchaser, including the holder of the mortgage, without regard to whether or not the purchaser is qualified under the provisions of this chapter to own or otherwise acquire the leased fee, the fee simple title, or the lease. The mortgage so held, and the interest so acquired by the purchaser on such foreclosure, shall be freely assignable, notwithstanding the provisions of section 516-35. The term, "lending institution," includes an insurer or guarantor of the obligation or condition of the mortgage, including the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or any other federal agency and their respective successors and assigns or any lending institution authorized to do business in the State or elsewhere in the United States; provided that the rights and powers of nongovernmental holders of mortgages shall not be any greater than those of the aforementioned federal agencies.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, in sales by the corporation of the leased fee or the fee simple title, or in leases of lots, the corporation may waive or modify any restrictions contained in this chapter, if such waiver or modification is necessary to enable any of aforementioned federal agencies or any lending institution authorized to do business in the State or elsewhere in the United States to participate in any loan secured by a mortgage on the leased fee, the fee simple interest or the lease; provided any such waiver or modification shall not confer any greater rights or powers in the holder than those which would be required by the Federal Housing Administration.
