<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Owner's basis" means the value of the lessor's leased fee interest in the lot that would apply if such interests were normally traded on an open market. The fair market value of the owner's basis shall be established to provide the lessor with just compensation for the lessor's interests in the lot and shall take into consideration every interest and equity of the lessee in establishing that market value.

The discount rate shall be based on the maximum rate of return for insured passbook demand saving account paid by the savings and loan institutions in Hawaii plus three and three-fourths per cent; provided, however, that the discount rate may be modified by mutual agreement of the lessor, lessee, and the corporation; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) The current fair market value of the lot, valued as if it were a fee simple lot and as if the fee title were unencumbered, and excluding onsite improvements, established by a market data approach utilizing comparable sales, less the following:</p>

<p class="ASubparagraph"> (E) That amount, not otherwise deducted herein, allocated to the lot, which was paid for or otherwise contributed, directly or indirectly by the original lessee, computed at prevailing rates for overhead and profit in developing the development tract established by existing practice in the community; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (F) That amount for fees and costs which would ordinarily be borne by lessor in transferring such interest to lessee, including, but not limited to, attorneys' or realtors' commissions, other costs of sale, and similar fee;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) All residential lots sold in satisfaction of paragraph (1) or (2) shall be leased under sustainable affordable leases;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) The state or county agency that approves the sustainable affordable development may reduce the minimum percentage of residential lots to be sold in satisfaction of paragraph (1) or (2) upon a showing that the sustainable affordable development comprises a portion of a housing project that includes other housing, which together with the residential lots comprising the sustainable affordable development, satisfies the state or county agency's affordable housing requirements as set forth in the applicable state or county law, regulation, policy, or agreement; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) For the purposes of this chapter, the residential lots in a development tract comprising a sustainable affordable development are not required to be in a single contiguous area as long as all non-contiguous lots are:</p>
