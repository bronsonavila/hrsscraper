<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> The department of human services has the discretion to make permanent placement decisions, subject to review by the family court, which is authorized and required by law to determine whether the placement is in the child's best interests. 132 H. 368, 322 P.3d 263 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The family court is not required to relieve the department of human services (DHS) of its permanent custodianship over a child if the family court disagrees with DHS' permanent placement decision. 132 H. 368, 322 P.3d 263 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The party challenging the department of human services' (DHS) permanent placement determination bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that DHS' permanent placement determination is not in the best interests of the child. 132 H. 368, 322 P.3d 263 (2014).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Department of human services does not have the discretion to determine a child's permanent placement pursuant to, inter alia, subsection (d)(2); subsection (d)(2) characterizes the department's permanent placement authority as a "duty" and "right", but nowhere suggests that the department may exercise that authority in its discretion. 130 H. 486 (App.), 312 P.3d 1193 (2013).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Family court did not err, as a matter of law, by denying department of human services' request to be discharged as the child in question's permanent custodian, after ordering the department not to place the child with the child's maternal aunt; the Hawaii supreme court has never held that where the family court rejects a department of human services placement recommendation, the supreme court should revoke the department's custody. 130 H. 486 (App.), 312 P.3d 1193 (2013).</p>
