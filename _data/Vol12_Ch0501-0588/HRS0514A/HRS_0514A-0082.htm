<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where the association bylaws stating that "action by a majority of directors present at any meeting" constitutes "action by the board" required that directors abstaining from a vote be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a majority of the board directors "present" at a meeting have acted--pursuant to Robert's Rules of Order as mandated by subsection (a)(16) (2003)--when board voted on the pricing policy at the meeting, and of the seven directors present at the meeting, two abstained and only three voted in favor, the policy was not validly adopted. 121 H. 474, 221 P.3d 452 (2009).</p>
