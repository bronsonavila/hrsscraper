<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of developer on association's implied warranty of habitability claim where developer failed to follow the dictates of this section to disclaim warranties; it did not appear that an abstract containing the requisite information on warranties was prepared by developer, and it reasonably followed that "each prospective initial purchaser" was not provided with such an abstract, as required by subsection (a). 115 H. 232, 167 P.3d 225 (2007).</p>
