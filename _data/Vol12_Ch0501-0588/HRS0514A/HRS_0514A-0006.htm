Property taxes assessed by a county shall be assessed on and collected on the individual apartments and not on the property as a whole. Without limitation of the foregoing, each apartment and the common interest appertaining thereto shall be deemed to be a parcel and shall be subject to separate assessment and taxation for all types of taxes authorized by law, including, but not limited to, special assessments.
