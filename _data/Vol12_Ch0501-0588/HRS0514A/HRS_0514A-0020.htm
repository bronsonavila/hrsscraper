<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง514A-20 Condominium property regimes.</b> Whenever the sole owner or all of the owners including all of the lessees of a property expressly declare, through the execution and recordation of a master deed, together with a declaration, which declaration shall set forth the particulars enumerated by section 514A-11, the sole owner's or their desire to submit the property to the regime established by this chapter, there shall thereby be established a condominium property regime with respect to the property, and this chapter shall be applicable to the property. If the master deed is already recorded, the recordation of the declaration is sufficient to achieve the same result. [L 1977, c 98, pt of ยง2; gen ch 1985; am L 1988, c 65, ยง2]</p>
