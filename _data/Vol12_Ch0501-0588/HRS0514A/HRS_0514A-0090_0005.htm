The tenant's payment under this section shall discharge that amount of payment from the tenant's rent obligation, and any contractual provision to the contrary shall be void as a matter of law.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> (b) Prior to taking any action under this section, the board of directors shall give to the delinquent apartment owner written notice of its intent to collect the rent owed. The notice shall:</span></p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Be sent both by first-class and certified mail;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Set forth the exact amount the association claims is due and owing by the apartment owner; and</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> (d) The payment of any portion of the apartment's share of common expenses by the tenant pursuant to a written demand by the board is a complete defense, to the extent of the amount demanded and paid by the tenant, in an action for nonpayment of rent brought by the apartment owner against a tenant.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> (e) The board may not demand payment from the tenant pursuant to this section if:</span></p>

Nothing herein precludes the apartment owner or tenant from seeking equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction or seeking a judicial determination of the amount owed.</span></p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> (g) Before the board of directors may take the actions permitted under subsection (a), the board shall adopt a written policy providing for the actions and have the policy approved by a majority vote of the apartment owners at an annual or special meeting of the association or by the written consent of a majority of the apartment owners.
