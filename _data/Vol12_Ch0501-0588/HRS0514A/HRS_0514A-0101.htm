An individual shall not be deemed to have complete possessory control of the premises if the individual rents, leases, or assigns the premises for any period of time to any other person in whose name legal title is not held; except that an individual shall be deemed to have complete possessory control even when the individual conveys or transfers the apartment into a trust for estate planning purposes and continues in the use of the premises as the individual's principal residence during this period.</p>
