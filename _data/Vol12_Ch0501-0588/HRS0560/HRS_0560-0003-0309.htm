<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§560:3-309</b> <b>Informal appointment proceedings; registrar not satisfied.</b> If the registrar is not satisfied that a requested informal appointment of a personal representative should be made because of failure to meet the requirements of sections 560:3-307 and 560:3-308, or for any other reason, the registrar may decline the application. A declination of informal appointment is not an adjudication and does not preclude appointment in formal proceedings. [L 1996, c 288, pt of §1]</p>
