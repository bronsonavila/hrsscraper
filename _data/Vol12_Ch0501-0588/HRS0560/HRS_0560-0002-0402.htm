<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง560:2-402 Homestead allowance.</b> A decedent's surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary is entitled to a homestead allowance of $15,000. If there is no surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, each minor child and each dependent child of the decedent is entitled to a homestead allowance amounting to $15,000 divided by the number of minor and dependent children of the decedent. The homestead allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims against the estate. Homestead allowance is in addition to any share passing to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary or minor or dependent child by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share.
