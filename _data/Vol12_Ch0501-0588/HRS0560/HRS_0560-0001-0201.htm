<p class="XNotesHeading">Case Notes</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Appellant was not an "interested person", as defined in this section, who could petition the court under ยง560:3-614 for appointment as special administrator where appellant had no familial relationship to decedent's family, did not have a property right or claim against decedent's estate, and did not have priority under ยง560:3-203 to be appointed as personal representative of decedent's estate; circuit court thus properly denied appellant's petition. 88 H. 148, 963 P.2d 1124.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The term "interested person" as defined in this section does not include a party interested solely in challenging a closure order in a probate proceeding; where appellants did not "possess an interest in the estate itself" nor were trustees, heirs, devisees, children, spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, creditors, or beneficiaries, trial court correctly denied appellant media's petition to intervene as "interested persons". 106 H. 453, 106 P.3d 1096.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Current income beneficiary of trust lacked standing to participate in matter concerning the distribution of the corpus upon termination of the trust where income beneficiary did not have any interest in the estate that would be affected by the particular probate proceeding inasmuch as income beneficiary was merely a measuring life and not a residuary beneficiary, and income beneficiary's interest was not a property right in or claim against the estate. 109 H. 502, 128 P.3d 815.</p>
