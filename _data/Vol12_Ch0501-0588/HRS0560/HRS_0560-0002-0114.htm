<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) An adopted individual is the child of the child's adopting parent or parents and not of the child's natural parents, except that:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Adoption of a child by the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of either natural parent has no effect on:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) The relationship between the child and that natural parent; or</p>

<p class="XNotes"> The term "may", as set forth in subsection (a), is permissive, and, for purposes of intestate succession, a purported heir may establish his or her parent-child relationship with the decedent by any means permitted by statute, including, but not limited to, chapter 584. 103 H. 275, 81 P.3d 1190.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Trial court did not err in failing to apply this section as it did not apply to either the testamentary trust or the life insurance trust for purposes of determining whether daughter was the "issue" of natural father. 105 H. 284, 96 P.3d 1098.</p>
