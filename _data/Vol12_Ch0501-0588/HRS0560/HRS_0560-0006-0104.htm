<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) On death of the sole original payee or of the survivor of two or more original payees, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the payable-on-death payee or payees if surviving, or to the survivor of them if one or more die before the original payee; if two or more payable- on-death payees survive, there is a right of survivorship in the event of death of a payable-on- death payee thereafter. </p>
