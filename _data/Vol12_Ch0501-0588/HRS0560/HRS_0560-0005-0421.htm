<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง560:5-421 Title by appointment. </b>(a) The appointment of a conservator vests title in the conservator as trustee to all property of the protected person, or to the part thereof specified in the order, held at the time of appointment or thereafter acquired, including title to any property held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys-in-fact. An order vesting title in the conservator to only a part of the property of the protected person creates a conservatorship limited to assets specified in the order.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) Letters of conservatorship are evidence of vesting title of the protected person's assets in the conservator. An order terminating a conservatorship transfers title to assets remaining subject to the conservatorship, including any described in the order, to the formerly protected person or the person's successors.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) Subject to the requirements of other laws governing the filing or recordation of documents of title to land or other property, letters of conservatorship and orders terminating conservatorships may be filed or recorded to give notice of title as between the conservator and the protected person.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Except as limited in the appointing order, a conservator has the authority to continue, modify, or revoke any financial power of attorney previously created by the protected person.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Upon notice of the appointment of a conservator, all agents acting under a previously created power of attorney by the protected person shall:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Take no further actions without the direct written authorization of the conservator;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Promptly report to the conservator as to any action taken under the power of attorney; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Promptly account to the conservator for all actions taken under the power of attorney.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect previously created medical decision-making authority. Any agent violating this section shall be liable to the protected person's estate for all costs incurred in attempting to obtain compliance, including, but not limited to reasonable conservator and attorney fees and costs.
