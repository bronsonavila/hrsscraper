<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where judge, at the time judge entered the family court orders purporting to void the estate documents, was a district judge appointed under §571-8, not a circuit judge sitting by designation in family court under §571-4, the judge lacked original jurisdiction over guardianships of the property under this section as it stood prior to the 1996 amendments to the Hawaii uniform probate code. 110 H. 8, 129 P.3d 511.</p>
<p class="XNotes"></p>
<p class="XNotes"><b>Prior law.</b></p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where definition of "incapacitated person" in §560:5-101 (2003), when read as a whole, sufficiently apprised ward of the bases on which the court would review the guardianship petition and any ambiguity in the statute did not render it "substantially incomprehensible", so as to overcome the "presumption of constitutionality", definition was not unconstitutionally vague. 113 H. 236, 151 P.3d 717 (2007).</p>
