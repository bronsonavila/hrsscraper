Unless otherwise directed by the court, the cost of the bond shall be charged to the protected person's estate and<b><i> </i></b>the bond shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate in the conservator's control, plus one year's estimated income, and minus the value of assets deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the court for their removal and the value of any real property that the fiduciary, by express limitation, lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization.
