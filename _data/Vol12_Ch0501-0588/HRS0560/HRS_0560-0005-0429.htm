<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>ยง560:5-429 Presentation and allowance of claims. </b>(a) A conservator may pay, or secure by encumbering assets of the estate, claims against the estate or against the protected person arising before or during the conservatorship upon their presentation and allowance in accordance with the priorities stated in subsection (d). A claimant may present a claim by:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Sending or delivering to the conservator a written statement of the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Filing a written statement of the claim, in a form acceptable to the court, with the clerk of court and sending or delivering a copy of the statement to the conservator.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) A claim is deemed presented on receipt of the written statement of claim by the conservator or the filing of the claim with the court, whichever first occurs. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement sent or delivered by the conservator to the claimant within sixty days after its presentation. The conservator, before payment, may change an allowance to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court order or judgment or an order directing payment of the claim. The presentation of a claim tolls the running of any statute of limitations relating to the claim until thirty days after its disallowance.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (c) A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for determination of the claim at any time before it is barred by a statute of limitations and, upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance, payment, or security by encumbering assets of the estate. If a proceeding is pending against a protected person at the time of appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the protected person thereafter, the moving party shall give to the conservator notice of any proceeding that could result in creating a claim against the estate.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) If it appears that the estate is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in money or in kind in payment of claims in the following order:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Costs and expenses of administration;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Claims of the federal or state government having priority under other law;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Claims incurred by the conservator for support, care, education, health, and welfare previously provided to the protected person or individuals who are in fact dependent on the protected person;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) Claims arising before the conservatorship; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) All other claims.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (e) Preference shall not be given in the payment of a claim over any other claim of the same class, and a claim due and payable shall not be preferred over a claim not due.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (f) If assets of the conservatorship are adequate to meet all existing claims, the court, acting in the best interest of the protected person, may order the conservator to grant a security interest in the conservatorship estate for the payment of any or all claims at a future date.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (g) Nothing in this section affects or prevents:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) Any proceeding to enforce any mortgage, pledge, or other lien upon property of the estate; or</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) To the limits of the insurance protection only, any proceeding to establish liability of the protected person for which the protected person is protected by liability insurance. [L 2004, c 161, pt of ยง1]</p>
