<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) An original, duly executed and apparently unrevoked will is in the registrar's possession;</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (6) Any notice required by sections 560:3-204 and 560:3-306 has been given and that the application is not within section 560:3-304; and</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (7) It appears from the application that the time limit for original probate has not expired.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (b) The application shall be denied if it indicates that a personal representative has been appointed in another judicial circuit of this State or except as provided in subsection (d), if it appears that this or another will of the decedent has been the subject of a previous probate order.</p>

In other cases, the registrar may assume execution if the will appears to have been properly executed, or the registrar may accept a sworn statement or affidavit of any person having knowledge of the circumstances of execution, whether or not the person was a witness to the will.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> (d) Informal probate of a will which has been previously probated elsewhere may be granted at any time upon written application by any interested person, together with deposit of an authenticated copy of the will and of the statement probating it from the office or court where it was first probated.</p>
