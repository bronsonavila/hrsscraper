The court shall forthwith enter an order forwarding the property to the state director of finance, and the clerk thereupon shall immediately deposit the money or funds, or any balance, with the director for disposition as provided in chapter 523A. The director at any time may authorize the payment out of the unclaimed property trust fund under section 523A-26 any amount so forwarded to any person who establishes to the satisfaction of the director that the person is legally entitled thereto as an heir or devisee of the decedent, and the person shall be entitled to receive the amount thereof out of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, upon warrant drawn by the state comptroller.
