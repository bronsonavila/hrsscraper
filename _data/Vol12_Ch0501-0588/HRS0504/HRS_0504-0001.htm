<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §504-1 Registration of federal judgments.</b> Judgments of United States courts may be registered, recorded, docketed, and indexed in the bureau of conveyances or with the assistant registrar of the land court in the same manner as judgments of the courts of the State. Except as otherwise provided, every judgment shall contain or have endorsed on it the State of Hawaii general excise taxpayer identification number, the federal employer identification number, or the last four digits only of the social security number for persons, corporations, partnerships, or other entities against whom the judgment is rendered. If the judgment debtor has no social security number, State of Hawaii general excise taxpayer identification number, or federal employer identification number, or if that information is not in the possession of the party seeking the registration, recordation, docketing, or indexing of the judgment, the judgment shall be accompanied by a certificate that provides that the information does not exist or is not in the possession of the party seeking registration, recordation, docketing, or indexing of the judgment. Failure to disclose or disclosure of an incorrect social security number, State of Hawaii general excise taxpayer identification number, or federal employer identification number shall not in any way adversely affect or impair the lien created upon the registration, recordation, docketing, or indexing of the judgment.
