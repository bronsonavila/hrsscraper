<p class="XNotes"><b> </b>Hawaii violation for breach of a protective order is not similar to contempt of court for sentencing purposes. 631 F.3d 1021 (2011).</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Based upon plain language of section, family court improperly required complainant to show recent acts of abuse at hearing. 90 H. 76, 976 P.2d 390.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Family court did not err in issuing the ex parte temporary restraining order and allowing it to remain in force until its expiration where father's threat to hit minor again, in conjunction with the two prior acts of physical harm as well as the allegation of recent psychological abuse, gave rise to a reasonable conclusion that the risk of further harm persisted and that a period of separation was necessary to prevent imminent harm. 125 H. 330 (App.), 260 P.3d 1148.</p>
