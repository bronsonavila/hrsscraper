Except as otherwise provided, every judgment shall contain or have endorsed on it the State of Hawaii general excise taxpayer identification number, the federal employer identification number, or the last four digits only of the social security number for persons, corporations, partnerships, or other entities against whom the judgment is rendered. If the judgment debtor has no social security number, State of Hawaii general excise taxpayer identification number, or federal employer identification number, or if that information is not in the possession of the party seeking registration of the judgment, the judgment shall be accompanied by a certificate that provides that the information does not exist or is not in the possession of the party seeking registration of the judgment.

<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiff obtained and recorded its judgment after pendency of foreclosure action was filed with land court, plaintiff had constructive notice of the lawsuit and was bound by state court's orders. 876 F. Supp. 230.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Pursuant to this section, §501-152, and TSA International, the circuit court has jurisdiction to expunge a lis pendens originally recorded in the land court and thus did not err when it asserted jurisdiction over the case. 101 H. 81, 63 P.3d 389.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The circuit court properly granted defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens where plaintiff's application for lis pendens did not seek to obtain title to or possession of the real property at issue, and thus was not valid. 101 H. 81, 63 P.3d 389.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Lis pendens and supplemental lis pendens invalid where plaintiffs' claims for relief did not fall within categories authorizing filing of lis pendens under this section. 85 H. 398 (App.), 944 P.2d 1341.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Whether a lis pendens is valid under this section is determined by the nature of the relief sought in the recording parties' pleading. 85 H. 398 (App.), 944 P.2d 1341.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> Where plaintiffs filed a notice of pendency of action pursuant to this section and §634-51, magistrate judge's order, in applying Sports Shinko to the facts of the case to deny defendant's motion to expunge, was not clearly erroneous or contrary to law. 529 F. Supp. 2d 1206 (2007).</p>
