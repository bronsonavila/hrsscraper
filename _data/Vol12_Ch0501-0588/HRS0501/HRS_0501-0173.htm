<p class="RegularParagraphs"> <b>§501-173 Purchaser acquiring title through personal representative may have the same registered.</b> If any personal representative is authorized by the terms of any will to grant, bargain, sell, convey, mortgage, or otherwise deal with registered land, the personal representative may do so in the same manner as if the land were registered in the representative's name as personal representative. Before any instrument executed by the personal representative, pursuant to such authority, is filed or recorded with the assistant registrar of the land court, there shall be first filed or recorded with the assistant registrar a certified copy of the letters appointing the personal representative showing the powers of the personal representative, or a certified copy of an order granting the petition for authority, or a certified copy of an acknowledgment of authority, and either a certified copy of the order of the circuit court confirming the sale of the affected land or a certified copy of an affidavit filed in the circuit court of the personal representative made at the time of the deed, mortgage, lease, or other conveyance, attesting that the decedent's will does not require confirmation of the transaction and that no devisee or heir has demanded the confirmation. Any person who acquired title or any interest in registered land through or by virtue of the execution of the power vested in the personal representative may have the title or interest registered.
