<p class="RegularParagraphs"> As soon as an application is disposed of, the registrar shall make a memorandum stating the disposition of the case and shall send the same to the assistant registrar, who shall record and index it with the records of deeds in the bureau of conveyances, and in the index of applications. If the proceedings upon the application end in a decree of registration of title the land included therein shall, as soon as the decree is transcribed, as provided in section 501-75, become registered land. Thereafter no deeds or other instruments relating solely to such land shall be recorded with the records of deeds, but shall be registered in the registration book and filed or recorded and indexed with the records and documents relating to registered land.
