<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Buyer" means the party who has agreed to purchase, and "seller" means the party who has agreed to sell the real estate pursuant to an agreement of sale, and includes each of their respective assignees and successors in interest in the agreement of sale.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Conveyance" means every written instrument by which any estate or interest in real estate is voluntarily created, alienated, mortgaged, or encumbered, or by which title to any real estate may be voluntarily affected, other than wills.</p>

<p class="RegularParagraphs"> "Satisfaction of agreement of sale" means the full performance of the buyer's obligations under the agreement of sale, and:</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) The buyer's compliance or tender of compliance with all of the buyer's filed written agreements and filed written consents, if any, with claimants whose claims are superior or subject to the rights of the buyer, and with all filed written directions, if any, of the seller to the buyer to make payments under the agreement of sale to a claimant or claimants;</p>

<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) The buyer's payment of all periodic, interim, prepaid, and final payments under the agreement of sale.</p>
<p class="RegularParagraphs"> If a claimant's claim or lien upon the real estate covered by the agreement of sale is extinguished according to this section before the claimant actually receives satisfaction of the claim or lien, the claim or lien shall be automatically transferred to the proceeds from satisfaction of the agreement of sale, in the same priority with respect to other transferred claims or liens on such real estate and with respect to other claims or liens on such proceeds, as the transferred claim or lien had immediately before such extinguishment.
