<p class="XNotes"> Pursuant to this section, §501-151, and TSA International, the circuit court has jurisdiction to expunge a lis pendens originally recorded in the land court and thus did not err when it asserted jurisdiction over the case. 101 H. 81, 63 P.3d 389.</p>
<p class="XNotes"> The circuit court properly granted defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens where plaintiff's application for lis pendens did not seek to obtain title to or possession of the real property at issue, and thus was not valid. 101 H. 81, 63 P.3d 389.</p>
