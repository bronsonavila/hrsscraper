<p class="RegularParagraphs"><b> §501-261 Deregistration of fee time share interests. </b>The certificate of title for each fee time share interest shall be canceled effective as of the date and time of deregistration of the fee time share interest. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 501-261 in existence prior to July 1, 2012, a fee time share interest for which a certificate of title was not recorded in the bureau of conveyances pursuant to chapter 502 and part II of this chapter prior to July 1, 2012, shall be deregistered on July 1, 2012, at 12:01 a.m.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (1) From and after July 1, 2012, the assistant registrar may, and upon a written request to the assistant registrar by a party in interest with respect to a certificate of title, the assistant registrar shall:</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (A) Note on the certificate of title for each fee time share interest all documents and instruments affecting the fee time share interest:</p>
<p class="iClause"> (i) That were or are registered as of a date and time prior to the date and time of deregistration of the fee time share interest; and</p>
<p class="iClause"> (ii) That were not yet noted on the certificate of title of the fee time share interest as of the earlier to occur of: the date and time of deregistration thereof; or the date and time of cancellation of the certificate of title; and</p>
<p class="ASubparagraph"> (B) Certify the certificate of title.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (2) Section 501-196 shall apply to a certificate of title updated pursuant to paragraph (1) upon approval of the same by the assistant registrar, which approval shall be evidenced by a certification of the assistant registrar endorsed upon the certificate of title. A certificate of title for a fee time share interest, including but not limited to a certificate of title recorded prior to July 1, 2012, pursuant to part II of this chapter, shall not be considered completed or approved, and shall be subject to modification by the assistant registrar, at any time prior to certification thereof by the assistant registrar. Subsequent to the certification, the certificate of title for a fee time share interest may only be modified pursuant to section 501-196 or as otherwise provided in this chapter.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (3) Upon certification of the certificate of title for a fee time share interest by the assistant registrar, the assistant registrar shall mark the certificate of title "canceled", note the cancellation of the certificate of title in the registration book, and notify the court and the state surveyor of the cancellation. The registrar shall thereupon be authorized to file a record of the cancellation in the application or consolidation file, and the state surveyor shall then be authorized to annotate the land court map or maps by identifying thereon the deregistered land and noting thereon the bureau of conveyances document number of the canceled certificate. The assistant registrar may adopt procedures, if any, as it may deem appropriate to reflect the cancellation of the uncertified fee time share interest certificates of title and the state surveyor may annotate the land court map or maps by identifying thereon the deregistration of land covered by uncertified fee time share certificates of title. Regardless of the date upon which any such administrative acts are performed, the cancellation of the certificate of title for a fee time share interest shall be effective as of the date and time of deregistration of that fee time share interest.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (4) If only part of the land described in the certificate of title consists of a fee time share interest, then upon the petition of the registered owner of that portion of the registered land not constituting a fee time share interest, a new certificate of title shall be issued to the owner for that portion of the registered land not constituting a fee time share interest. If registered land is held in the condominium form of ownership, then for purposes of this subsection each condominium apartment or condominium unit for which a separate certificate of title has been issued shall be treated as if it were a separate parcel of registered land.</p>
<p class="1Paragraph"> (5) Except as provided in paragraph (4), no order of court shall be required prior to or in connection with the performance of any of the foregoing actions or to reflect or effect the cancellation of the certificate of title for a fee time share interest or otherwise to reflect or effect the withdrawal of the fee time share interest from the operation of this chapter.
