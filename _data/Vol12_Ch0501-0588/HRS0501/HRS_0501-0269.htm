Where any party is in doubt as to whether an instrument must be registered, the question shall be referred to the land court for decision; and the court, after notice to all parties and a hearing, shall enter an order determining the question. Notice to the owner of a fee time share interest shall be given by mailing notice to the association of time share owners required to be established pursuant to section 514E-29, and the association shall represent the owners in any matters and proceedings, without prejudice to the right of any individual owner to appear and be heard as a separate party. Except as expressly provided in this section, nothing in this part shall deprive the land court of exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to section 501-1 over registered land, or any interest therein, other than registered land that becomes deregistered land. The circuit court shall have jurisdiction, pursuant to section 603-21.5(a)(3), over:</p>
